Piers Morgan has announced he’s set to appear on ITV daytime for the first time since his infamous exit from Good Morning Britain. Back in March 2021, Piers stormed off the set of GMB when he was called out on air by colleague Alex Beresford for comments he’d made about Meghan Markle during the previous day’s broadcast, when he called into question her claims that she’d experienced suicidal thoughts during her time as a senior royal. That night, shortly after it was announced his comments had led to an Ofcom investigation, the divisive presenter revealed he was stepping down from the daytime show with immediate effect. Having now left ITV completely, he is gearing up for the launch of his new TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored, and will be returning to his old stomping ground to help promote it. On Wednesday, he teased that he’d be stopping by Lorraine Kelly’s show later this week, tweeting: “BREAKING: I’ll be returning to ITV tomorrow for first time since the Markle Debacle… live & definitely uncensored on ⁦Lorraine with the fabulous ⁦[Lorraine Kelly].” “Should be fun,” he added, joking that he “may even storm back onto ⁦GMB⁩ while I wait – and get those ratings back up”.

Last week, Piers spoke out about his exit from Good Morning Britain, branding his departure “ridiculous” and “a farce”. He also opened up about his “difficult” TV “divorce” from Susanna Reid, with whom he presented GMB for five years. Lorraine airs every weekday from 9am on ITV.
