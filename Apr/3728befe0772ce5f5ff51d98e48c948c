Kids may say the darndest things, but parents tweet about them in the funniest ways. So each week, we round up the most hilarious quips from parents on Twitter to spread the joy. Scroll down to read the latest batch, and follow @HuffPostParents on Twitter for more! Tried to throw a slightly neglected baby doll into the toy basket and my three year old shrieked “THAT’S MY DAUGHTER!!” Had no idea What’s the eeriest thing a child has ever said to you? When my daughter was around 4-5, she calmly insisted that she had once been married to a man named Brad Huffington. When we asked what had happened to him she replied with a note of sadness, “He was lost at sea.” My 7 year-old son had a playdate with a girl yesterday. After about 10 mins he asked if she wanted to go upstairs and see his 'pound machine'. Somewhat concerned, we followed them up and found them taking turns standing on the bathroom scale. Crisis averted, for now. My wife: Have the kids been acting weird today?Me: I don't think it's an act. Caught my kids playing rock, paper, scissors WITH ACTUAL SCISSORS Thinking about the time my 3yo forgot the name for chicken nuggets and called them “orange meat cookies” something they don’t warn you about parenting is you will watch Frozen 8,000 times and want to die and then one day when your kid is asleep you won’t know what to watch and suddenly a tiny part of you will be like hmm you know what would really hit the spot? FROZEN My kid kept asking if he could try the chicken milk pic.twitter.com/AtRl9kRKG0 Me: Why aren’t you ready? We’re late! 10: Did you know the amount of people older than you never increases? 10 wanted to make dinner and mixed random ingredients like eggs, flour, crackers, dried pasta and ketchup, then baked it until it was burnt and my twins said it was the nicest dinner they’d ever tasted so I resigned and now I live on a faraway island Freaked out so many parents by asking this in a wrong school chat pic.twitter.com/CxODYmIYzr As a parent I just feel like a big fat liar: Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, Mommy and Daddy were just wrestling, etc. Did you have a good weekend or did your 4 y/o tell a lady with grey hair in the greeting card isle to “Move it old lady!”? Us: Takes 5yr old to Disney5yr old: Is there Target here? Parenting is begging for a night away from the kids then talking about them the whole time like a couple of Stockholmies 5: mom can i fart on you? HAVE KIDS THEY SAID When my family wants me to turn the music down and I have to let them know that I’m cleaning and I absolutely will not pic.twitter.com/Epxd4ONDJy The other night I told 5 if he left his room one more time instead of going to sleep that I was taking one of his stuffed animals. He left his room again. When I went in his room, he had an assortment of animals laid out and told me I “could choose one of these”. 🤬 Pretending I'm still asleep so my husband has to make the kids' breakfast is my favorite weekend tradition I’m trying to be grateful for one thing each day. Today I’m grateful that my kids are old enough to make their own dinner after they tell me they hate my cooking. Everything will be going fine and then your kid asks you if people can get pregnant in heaven. Everyday I pick my kid up from school he announces “I didn’t bite anybody!” and you know what?  I’m pretty proud I didn’t bite anybody either
