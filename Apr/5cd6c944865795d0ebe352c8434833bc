Emma Corrin was the talk of the Olivier Awards on Sunday night when they graced the red green carpet in a campy balloon dress. The 26-year-old Crown star, who uses she/they pronouns, turned heads in the balloon print dress from Jonathan Anderson’s fall 2022 collection for Loewe, complete with a pair of deflated balloons cast as a kind of breastplate. And to complete the look? A pair of black patent leather boots, complete with (what else?) balloon heels. Sharing a picture of Emma’s outfit on Instagram, their stylist Harry Lambert captioned the snap: “This one is for the gays”. A revival of the musical Cabaret and a stage adaptation of Life of Pi were the big winners at Sunday’s bash held at London’s Royal Albert Hall as the stage industry celebrated a year in which performances resumed after lockdown. Cabaret stars Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley won acting prizes while the show was named Best Musical Revival after leading the nominations with 11 nods. Life of Pi, based on the Booker Prize-winning novel and staged at London’s Wyndham’s Theatre, was named Best New Play and scooped several technical prizes. The play’s lead, Hiran Abeysekera, also won Best Actor, while the seven performers who play the tiger shared the Best Supporting Actor prize.
