Matt Lucas has laughed off accusations of favouritism after appearing as a contestant on The Great British Bake Off.  The Little Britain comedian, who usually presents the Channel 4 show with Noel Fielding, stepped in at the 11th hour after a celebrity baker fell ill just before filming.  As the show aired on Tuesday, some fans were not impressed when Matt received help from judge Paul Hollywood as he and fellow bakers Ed Gamble, Annie Mac and Example made biscuits. Matt then later received one of Paul’s coveted Hollywood Handshakes for his efforts, which judge Prue Leith tried to stop.

I don’t care. I got a Hollywood Handshake and I won the Technical,” he tweeted. “Plus I know where they keep the Star Baker aprons so I’m going to take one anyway. Plus I’m an icon and a national treasure.” Say what you like. I don’t care. I got a Hollywood Handshake and I won the Technical. Plus I know where they keep the Star Baker aprons so I’m going to take one anyway. Plus I’m an icon and a national treasure. https://t.co/4RuSsy0NLP While Matt did win the technical challenge, he missed out on being crowned Star Baker to musician Example.  Matt previously claimed he was “forced” into participating on the show, telling The Mirror: “I was forced to bake by my bosses at the last minute when one of the bakers became unavailable. I can’t tell you how happy I was that my humiliation was caught on camera. “I once tried to bake a cake, but already I started tampering with the recipe and the cake, I mean, talk about soggy bottom. “It was inedible. I’m happy to eat the cakes, but I’m not a great baker.” The Great Celebrity Bake Off For Stand Up To Cancer continues on Tuesday at 8pm on Channel 4.
