Some of RuPaul’s Drag Race’s most legendary queens took us on a trip down memory lane at the Grammys this weekend, paying homage to some of the awards show’s most iconic looks. On Sunday night, Trinity K Bonet, Derrick Barry, Naomi Smalls, Alexis Mateo, Kameron Michaels, Jaida Essence Hall and Coco and Kahanna Montrese were all in attendance on the biggest night in music in Las Vegas. The queens – who are part of the cast of Drag Race’s current Vegas show – were at the awards show to present backstage coverage for the awards show on TikTok. And posing on the red carpet, they gave us a tribute to past divas’ most memorable Grammys outfits. Among them were Kameron Michaels’ replica of when Lady Gaga paid tribute to David Bowie in 2016… Naomi Smalls “giving Cher”... And Coco Montrese paying homage to her personal icon, Janet Jackson… But our personal scene-stealer was this complete serve from All Stars 6 favourite Trinity K Bonet, who gave us a perfect recreation of Ariana Grande’s stunning look from 2020… The 2022 Grammys were held in Las Vegas on Sunday night, after being moved from its original date earlier in the year due to high Covid numbers.
