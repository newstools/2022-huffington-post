Boris Johnson has flown to Kyiv for “surprise” talks with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Downing Street said the prime minister made the unannounced trip “in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people”. The lightning visit was revealed in a tweet by the Ukrainian embassy in London, which showed Johnson holding talks with Zelensky. Above the picture was a winking emoji and “surprise”.

A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The prime minister has travelled to Ukraine to meet President Zelenskyy in person, in a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people. “They will discuss the UK’s long term support to Ukraine and the PM will set out a new package of financial and military aid.” It is the first time the prime minister has visited Ukraine since the Russian invasion on February 24. Number 10 later issued a picture appearing to show the two leaders on a walkabout in Kyiv.
