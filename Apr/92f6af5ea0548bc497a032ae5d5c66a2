This year’s bumpy awards season came to an end on Sunday night with the biggest night in the music calendar – the Grammys. And while it’s safe to say the night was considerably less shocking than the Oscars that came just a week earlier, that’s not to say it wasn’t an action-packed show. Between controversial wins, remarkable performances from some of the world’s most prolific musicians and a comedy skit from the unlikeliest of sources, here are 27 must-see moments from the 2022 Grammys...
