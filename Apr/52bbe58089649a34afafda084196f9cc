Jazz and R&B singer Jon Batiste led the way at this year’s Grammys, scooping five of the 11 awards he was nominated for.  Sunday night marked Jon’s first ever Grammy victories, with the American musician taking home a string of awards over the course of the ceremony, including the coveted Album Of The Year title. Elsewhere, (in what it has to be said turned out to be a truly sparse night for British talent), Olivia Rodrigo also celebrated her first triumphs at the Grammys. As well as becoming the fifth consecutive female artist to land Best New Artist, she also took home Best Pop Vocal Album for her debut release Sour and Best Pop Solo Peformance for her smash hit Drivers License. Meanwhile, Silk Sonic’s Leave The Door Open was named both Song Of The Year and Record Of The Year, while Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett’s second duets album Love For Sale was named Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Foo Fighters picked up two awards in rock music categories, but were not in attendance, following the death of their drummer Taylor Hawkins just over a week ago. As you may know, the Grammys have over 80 categories, so here’s an abridged winners list from this year’s ceremony...
