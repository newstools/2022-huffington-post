Every year, the Grammys manage to pull in some seriously impressive A-list guests, and we’re happy to report that this year was no exception. On Sunday night, some of the biggest names in music gathered at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas to find out who would be taking home the industry’s most prestigious awards at the annual event. The 2022 ceremony was actually pushed back from its original date due to high Covid numbers earlier in the year, which meant the stars had to wait a little longer than anticipated to hit the red carpet. Fortunately, it was worth the wait – at least when it came to the looks being served as the stars made their way into the event. Olivia Rodrigo, Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish and Lady Gaga were all in the running for the coveted Album Of The Year title for their output in the last 12 months. Among the other stars vying for the night’s biggest prizes were Doja Cat, Justin Bieber, BTS and Bruno Mars, with British nominees including Ed Sheeran, Arlo Parks and Sir Paul McCartney. But it’s not just the nominees that turned looks on the red carpet. Talk show star Trevor Noah was on hosting duties for the second year running, after impressing with his efforts during last year’s Grammys. Presenters over the course of the night included Megan Thee Stallion (also up for two awards on the night), Dua Lipa and Pose stars Billy Porter and MJ Rodriguez.
