Jeremy Vine’s Channel 5 show was forced off air on Monday after a “significant” power outage at the studios. The mid-morning topical discussion programme was replaced with repeats of Million Pound Home after the power and the back-up generator reportedly failed in the area surrounding ITN Productions’ HQ in at Gray’s Inn Road in central London. Jeremy revealed that staff had decamped in the building’s foyer as they waited for the issue to be resolved. Power cut @ITNProductions  so we are all in reception. Here's hoping @JeremyVineOn5 is with you at 0915‼️ pic.twitter.com/QexGgt8BhH Unfortunately, the issue was not fixed in time for any of Jeremy’s show to air.  He tweeted: “Sorry to say, we didn’t make it to air today. “Questions will be asked of the emergency generator, and the emergency backup generator. “But nice to get some quality catch-up time with my esteemed co-presenter @StormHuntley.” In @itn reception earlier waiting for news that power had been restored — still, a good chance to catch up with broadcast buddy @StormHuntley pic.twitter.com/BWLbQLWrby An ITN spokesperson said: “A power outage this morning has affected a number of buildings and businesses in the Gray’s Inn Road area. We have therefore moved to our backup protocols to protect our news output, which has continued to air today.” Channel 4 News and ITV Lunchtime News, which are also stationed in the same building as Jeremy Vine, both later aired as normal. Jeremy Vine airs weekdays at 9.15am on Channel 5.
