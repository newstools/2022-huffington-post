Vladimir Putin has banned Boris Johnson and senior cabinet members from Russia over the UK’s “hostile” response to the war in Ukraine. Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab, foreign secretary Liz Truss, home secretary Priti Patel and defence secretary Ben Wallace have also been placed on a “stop list” preventing them from entering the country. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has also been included in the ban. The UK has been at the forefront of the west’s response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February, imposing wide-reaching economic sanctions on Putin and his allies. In a statement, the Kremlin said: “In connection with the unprecedented hostile actions of the British government, expressed, in particular, in the imposition of sanctions against top officials of the Russian Federation, a decision was made to include key members of the British government and a number of political figures in the Russian ‘stop list’.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK and our international partners stand united in condemning the Russian government’s reprehensible actions in Ukraine and calling for the Kremlin to stop the war.  “We remain resolute in our support for Ukraine.”
