The extent of the damage to Ukraine from the war is painfully clear from photos being shared on social media, showing life before and after the Russian invasion. Ukraine has been transformed by the brutality of the Russian forces in recent weeks, but there are fears the Kremlin is only going to get more aggressive. Amid unverified reports that chemical weapons have been used in Mariupol and claims Russia is gathering tens of thousands of troops for an eastern offensive, the UN says more than half of the country’s children have been displaced since the invasion. The devastation felt across the country is palpable in these photos and videos, showing just how life in Ukraine has turned completely upside down. Bucha, for instance, is just one of the many cities being targeted by the Russians. It made headlines last week after troops withdrew, and humanitarian workers and journalists uncovered the civilian massacre they left behind. The city of Bucha in Ukraine.
