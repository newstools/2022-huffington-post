Since making their debut on Gogglebox back in 2017, brother-and-sister duo Pete and Sophie Sandiford have become two of the show’s most-loved contributors.  With their silly sense of humour, hilarious pranks and genuine affection for one another, they have charmed audiences of the Channel 4 show.  As the pair continue to serve up more TV gold on the latest series, we’re proving why they are the gift that keeps on giving with some of their most memorable moments... “I mean my first question is, how have you got a fiancée?” “I look like fucking Rod Stewart.” “Not my Gibraltar tea towel.” Gogglebox airs Fridays at 9pm on Channel 4.
