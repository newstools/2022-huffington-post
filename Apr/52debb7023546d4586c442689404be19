If you were still a kid, there’s a chance you might have been teased at school. But who’s getting the last laugh, now that getting the right pair of specs is the ultimate style statement. We’re not saying eyewear doesn’t come with its own stresses and strains, especially when you add contacts lenses into the mix. In fact, from smears and glare on your glasses to dry, uncomfortable contacts, it can be a bit of a bore. Then there’s your contact-lens cleaning regime and the fiddly fixes required if you ever scratch or snap your frames (I speak from experience here). That’s not to mention the ‘steaming up’ issue that’s plagued glasses wearers since the start of the pandemic (faces masks, we’re looking at you!).  Thankfully, there are plenty of tools to help streamline your eyewear experience so that being short or long sighted needn’t be a drag. We’ve rounded up our pick of the best buys every glasses or contact lens wearer needs in their life.
