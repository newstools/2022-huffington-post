We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Far too often, those makeup tutorials you see on TikTok and YouTube use only the very best (and usually rather pricey) cult products, which can make it seem like achieving the same look with lower cost items is unachievable. Sigh.  But we’re here to tell you that isn’t the case. There are lots of low-budget makeup products that have the most incredible formulas and are just as good as the spenny stuff. (Yes, really.) To give you an insight into the best low-cost makeup formulas available, we’ve rounded up some of the top-rated makeup products under £20 available to buy from Amazon.
