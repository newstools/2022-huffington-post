However, in June 2021, Melanie shared that she had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in a blog post on her website.  She wrote at the time: “To say this sucks is the understatement of the century. I was only given the all clear from cancer 18 months ago and it’s a cruel blow to think that I will now be starting into some kind of treatment again and that this time it will be long term and a permanent fixture of my life. “It’s a lot to take in.” Melanie debuted in EastEnders in September 1997 when the soap aired a special week of episodes shot in Ireland.  Her character later made the move to Albert Square where she remained until February 1999.  Away from the soap, Melanie guest had guest roles in Doctors, Casualty and Fear City, and appeared as Lisa Bacchus in Inspector George Gently between 2009 and 2014.  She also appeared in the 2019 film Ordinary Love, which starred Liam Neeson.
