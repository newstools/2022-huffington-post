Nigel Farage has blamed an “algorithm” for the fall-off in the number of people following him on Twitter, as he called on the platform’s new owner to help fix the problem. Elon Musk was urged to come to the Brexiteer’s rescue as the ex-Ukip and Brexit Party leader complained in a video about having “zero growth” for 18 months with his Twitter engagement falling to an “all-time low”. But Farage received little sympathy on Twitter itself as many suggested it was perhaps a result of his increasing irrelevance in politics seven years after the Brexit vote, and more than a year since the UK left the European Union’s single market. For years I would gain 30,000 new Twitter followers per month and most tweets would get 5,000+ retweets.Now I've had zero growth for 18 months & engagement is at an all-time low. It's the same for thousands of others.Twitter's algorithm now needs to change — and change fast! pic.twitter.com/4w9rUALs2X He said: “Within the last few years (growth) has completely stopped. “I’ve had no growth on Twitter whatsoever, the stuff I put out and say gets seen by far fewer people. “Now it could be that my stuff is really dull and boring and I have nothing interesting to say, no original thoughts whatsoever.” With a nervous laugh, he added: “I don’t actually think that is the case.” Farage went on to admit he didn’t know how algorithms worked before calling on Musk to “drain the Twitter swamp”. “If anyone can do it, it’s this guy,” he added. Many people made a similar point about Farage being perhaps past his sell-by-date. Or no one is interested in your climate-denying, pro-Le Pen, pro-Trump, pro-Putin drivel anymore? https://t.co/zRVuhwI4dn Me when a new act overtakes me in comedy. https://t.co/kgoh9rRnKm British exporters to the EU    Nigel Farage’s Twitter account          🤝      virtually no growth in recent years Very revealing. A key reason Farage is a spent force in British politics is that the Tories adopted his policy prescriptions on virtually everything.Anyone else would be thrilled, but he's depressed because it was never about the issues and always about the attention & grift. pic.twitter.com/C0aKQxnt0i Seriously though, you’re playing on easy mode. Get some dignity and stop whining about algorithms and just accept you’re irrelevant now that you haven’t got being a member of the EU to whine about.https://t.co/URg0mvA8sf Look at Buck's Fizz's chart positions through the 1980s and it's exactly the same thing Nigel. It's not called "algorithms" it's called "irrelevance". https://t.co/E5DeRvtUOe This is so desperate it’s magnificent. https://t.co/urVYNNlod6 Dear Elon,Please provide a software solution for my increasingly desperate irrelevanceYoursNigel FarageChief Flag-Toad pic.twitter.com/g6KzhXw4kK
