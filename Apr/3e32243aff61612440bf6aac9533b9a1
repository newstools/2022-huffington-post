The stars of Gogglebox were just as traumatised as the rest of us after watching Friday’s episode of the Channel 4 show. In it, the armchair TV critics watched an x-rated episode of Apple TV’s anthology series Roar, which involved a woman and a duck getting, errrrm, intimate. Even the likes of Sophie and Pete and Jenny and Lee were (almost) lost for words as the scenes in The Woman Who Was Fed By A Duck played out, culminating in the feathered creature pleasuring his human companion.  The Goggleboxer’s reactions were priceless… Q. How do you seduce a duck?A. Seductively. #Roar #Gogglebox pic.twitter.com/IBgqlJ9Vg4 When you know what’s gonna happen… 🙈#Roar #Gogglebox pic.twitter.com/TgQOB7HdUY You’ll never think of a duck’s beak the same way…  🦆  #Roar #Gogglebox pic.twitter.com/ubTG9jc99P And viewers at home couldn’t believe their eyes either...

The anthology series “weaves together eight darkly comedic feminist fables that take unexpected approaches to subjects like gender roles, autonomy and identity”. And ducks. Gogglebox airs on Channel 4 at 9pm every Friday and is also available to watch on All4.
