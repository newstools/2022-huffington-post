But thankfully, the Aldi gods have answered our prayers, by bringing back their best-selling hanging egg chair on Sunday February 13. Available from 8am on Aldi Specialbuys, this sought-after Spring essential boasts a stylish rattan design, a sleek powder-coated frame, and comfortable cushions perfect for getting cosy in the garden or conservatory on sunny afternoons. But be quick – because as with all of Aldi’s Specialbuys – once they’re gone, they’re gone! Priced at a super reasonable £189.99, you’ll struggle to find a hanging chair that’s such good value for money. But if you happen to miss out on the Aldi option – or are looking for something a little different – here are some great alternatives that are available now with other retailers.
