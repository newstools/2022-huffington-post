Will Smith and Lady Gaga have both scored top acting nods at this year’s Baftas.  The former Fresh Prince Of Bel Air star is among the first time nominees in the performance categories this year, with a leading actor nomination for his role in King Richard, in which he stars as the father of tennis champions Serena and Venus Williams. Will, who won the Golden Globe for the role, is nominated alongside Benedict Cumberbatch for The Power Of The Dog, Mahershala Ali for Swan Song, Adeel Akhtar for Ali & Ava, Leonardo DiCaprio for Don’t Look Up and Stephen Graham for Boiling Point. In the leading actress category, Lady Gaga is up for House Of Gucci, where she played Patrizia Gucci. She is nominated alongside Alana Haim for Licorice Pizza, Emilia Jones for Coda, Renate Reinsve for The Worst Person In The World, Joanna Scanlan for After Love and Tessa Thompson for Passing.  Meanwhile, sci-fi film Dune is entering this year’s Baftas as the hot favourite after scoring the most nominations with 11.  The film, based on Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel and stars the likes of Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson and Oscar Isaac, is nominated for categories including original score, casting, cinematography and best film, but no nominations in the performance categories.  Western film The Power Of The Dog has received eight nominations among them best director for Jane Campion, best film, and three nominations across the acting categories. Sir Kenneth Branagh’s coming-of-age drama Belfast earns six nominations but is snubbed in one of the biggest categories – best director – while Jamie Dornan missed out on a supporting actor nod.  Nominated for supporting actor are Jesse Plemons and Kodi Smit-McPhee for The Power Of The Dog, West Side Story’s Mike Faist, Belfast’s Ciaran Hinds, Troy Kotsur for Coda and 11-year-old Woody Norman for C’mon C’mon, making him this year’s youngest nominee. In the supporting actress category are Belfast’s Caitriona Balfe, Jessie Buckley for The Lost Daughter, Ariana DeBose for West Side Story, Ann Dowd for Mass, Aunjanue Ellis for King Richard and Ruth Negga for Passing. Absences in the final list for the leading actress category include Olivia Colman and Kristen Stewart, while Kirsten Dunst also did not secure a shortlist nomination for her supporting role in The Power Of The Dog.  The nominations were announced by AJ Odudu and Tom Allen from Bafta’s London headquarters on Thursday.  This year’s Baftas take place on Sunday 13 March at the Royal Albert Hall.
