Valentine’s is a time for fun, love, laughter and intimacy but not if you’ve had words, you’re arguing, or you’re not talking at all.  Whether it’s about something silly or deeply personal, counsellor Sean Tierney says you (as a couple) have to find a way to talk about it. “One of the most important ways to move on after an argument is to acknowledge and articulate how you felt,” he says.
