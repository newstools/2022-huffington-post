Ant and Dec got the new series of Saturday Night Takeaway off to an incredible start this weekend, undergoing a sensational drag makeover and delivering a performance in character as their new alter-egos. On Saturday night, Ant and Dec were joined in the studio by celebrity guest announcer RuPaul, so it seemed only fitting that they should try their hand at drag for their “End Of The Show Show” segment. But don’t go thinking that meant smearing on some lipstick and charity shop wigs, people. Because when we say the Geordie duo went all in, we really mean it. Ant and Dec – or should we say Lady Antoinette and Miss Donna Lee – ended Saturday’s show with a performance that saw them unveiling their new “Angels Of The North” characters. Lip syncing to their new charity single We Werk Together, they were also joined on stage by all three Drag Race UK winners The Vivienne, Lawrence Chaney and Krystal Versace, marking the first time the trio had ever performed together. And it’s safe to say, viewers were well and truly gagged by Ant and Dec’s efforts… CAN WE PLZ TALK ABOUT ANT AND DEC IN DRAG???!!!

Farrah Moan’s sister https://t.co/NROl4WgIzv Ant and Dec really said if we're doing drag we're doing it properly and that made all the difference. And that is why @antanddec win so many NTAs.
