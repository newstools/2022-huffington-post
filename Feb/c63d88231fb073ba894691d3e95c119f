Fear not, the fix could be as giving your workspace a makeover (yes, really).  The truth is that if your desk isn’t set up to make working as comfortable and enjoyable as possible, then it’s easy to struggle with productivity.  The good news is that by making just a few small changes to your setup (whether that’s a home office or your desk at work), you can make a hell of a difference to your mindset. I speak from experience here; my own WFH setup was impacting my productivity, so I made some adjustments. You don’t have to splash out on an entire new desk (though we have found two really great ones if you want to). Often it’s the little things that make the biggest impact.  Not quite sure where to start? Don’t worry. We’ve pulled together some best buys that will work hard – so you can enjoy your nine to five a bit more.
