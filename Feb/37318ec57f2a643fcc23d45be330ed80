Anne-Marie isn’t about to let her on-stage tumble during this year’s Brit Awards get the better of her. During Tuesday night’s live show, the chart-topping star took to the stage where she and rapper KSI performed a medley of their respective hits. The performance began with the singer coming down a short staircase while performing her Little Mix collab Kiss My (Uh Oh). Unfortunately, as Madonna can attest, stairs and Brits performances don’t always mix, which Anne-Marie discovered the hard way as she lost her balance and fell down in the middle of her song. Anne Marie 😭😭😭 I screamed and I feel so bad but the way she carried on like a STAR 👏🏼 #BRITS #BRITS2022 pic.twitter.com/ZWseg6P6Im Following her on-stage mishap, Anne Marie joked on Twitter that she “didn’t need my left ankle anyway”. Didn’t need my left ankle anyway I AM DEAD. https://t.co/xharvdME3N The official Specsavers account then cheekily tweeted that the singer’s next visit was “on us”, to which Anne-Marie replied, “I’ll be in touch”. I’ll be in touch https://t.co/417KIgGeyA Following her fall, Brits viewers showered the singer in praise for not letting the slip-up get her down... well Anne Marie recovered from her fall like an absolute queen #brits2022 pic.twitter.com/6JPrdrRjSs Oh no Anne Marie 🙈😂 Poor Gal! I was literally thinking ‘if that was me I’d fall down those stairs’ and well…. I’m getting Madonna 2014 flashbacks! Good on her for carrying on though! Babe @AnneMarie remains my Queen. As someone who has fallen twice recently on a night out I feel this. Hard.The recovery was 🔥 (Also remember when it happened to Madonna? Proving the best of us fall and get up to slay)#BRITs Anne-Marie and KSI had been nominated for Song Of The Year for their Digital Farm Animals collaboration Don’t Play, but lost out to Adele’s number one smash Easy On Me. Earlier in the night, Anne-Marie was seen walking the red carpet where she and her close pal Ed Sheeran struck a pose for photographers. Adele was the big winner at this year’s ceremony.  The singer scooped three of the four prizes she was nominated for at the ceremony, including the coveted Album Of The Year prize. See the full list of winners here.
