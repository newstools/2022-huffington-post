We’ve seen some seriously random and completely unexpected famous faces unmasked on The Masked Singer, but the US version of the show has just (ahem) trumped all who have gone before. According to US reports, Donald Trump’s former adviser Rudy Giuliani is the latest ‘celebrity’ to have costumed up and belted out a tune for the hit show. However, the controversial politician’s big reveal reportedly didn’t go down well with some of the judging panel, with singer Robin Thicke and comedian Ken Jeong, walking off the show in protest. According to Deadline, Robin and Ken eventually returned to the judging panel to rejoin the two other judges, Nicole Scherzinger and Jenny McCarthy, who had remained and “bantered” with the former New York City mayor, who was recently subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol in January last year. Giuliani was one the speakers at Trump’s rally on 6 January 2021, contesting the 2020 election results that Congress was getting ready to certify. The former New York City mayor told the crowd that voting machines were rigged and that the matter needed to be settled with “trial by combat.”  If Giuliani appears as reported when the new series premieres in the States on 9 March ― singing and dancing before a panel of celebrities attempting to guess his identity ― he’ll be following in the footsteps of the GOP’s former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who competed in the show in 2020 as a pink and purple tie-dye bear.  Alas, there are no details on what costume Giuliani was wearing or what song he sang, but let’s hope he doesn’t sweat too much.
