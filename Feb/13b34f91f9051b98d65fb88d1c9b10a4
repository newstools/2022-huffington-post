While much of the world is debating how to handle Vladimir Putin and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, one Hollywood actress thinks she could have put a stop to it before it ever happened. AnnaLynne McCord, who played Naomi Clark in the rebooted “90210”from 2008 to 2013, on Thursday posted a video on Twitter with a personal, and peculiar, message to Putin. It begins with McCord saying “Dear President Vladimir Putin”, while subtitles in English (not Russian) appear below. Then, the 34-year-old actor apologises to the 69-year-old Russian leader for not giving birth to him. “I’m so sorry that I was not your mother. If I was your mother, you would have been so loved, held in the arms of joyous light. Never would this story’s plight. The world unfurled before our eyes. A pure demise.” It’s bizarre. See the whole two-minute, 20-second clip yourself.

I regret to inform you the celebrities are at it again. https://t.co/D42yfA3JX7 what the fuck is this?90210- come get your girl!! https://t.co/6It63RPKUw there's no fucking break from this world at all https://t.co/LmM5dx0pIp Boy this really nails the zeitgeist, and that's pretty terrifying. https://t.co/PbniKsssPt The new Anthropologie ad campaign is really something https://t.co/OGJ516IerU So far, there is no word if Putin has seen McCord’s video, but one person predicted his reaction to it. IF (and that's a big if) Putin sees this, he's probably laughing his ass off. https://t.co/88Vc3ws4w4 And, yes, many people couldn’t help but be reminded of another celebrity gaffe: Gal Gadot’s “Imagine” video from the beginning of the pandemic. This is up there with when they all sang Imagine during the start of lockdown https://t.co/bUVKrZ0OIe Did y'all learn NOTHING from Gal Gadot's "Imagine" disaster?!?!? https://t.co/Rf3XZbyA5A we did it boys, we waited and we got our new "imagine" courtesy of a star of the CW's 90210 reboot https://t.co/gkirFkk26u
