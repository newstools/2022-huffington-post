Papers were “periodically” found clogging up toilets in the White House residence during Donald Trump’s presidency, The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman writes in her upcoming book. White House staffers believed the then-president himself had blocked the pipes by trying to flush ripped-up pieces of paper, according to the “Confidence Man” author. Axios shared details from the book, scheduled for release later this year, on Thursday.
