Adele has got everyone talking for one reason only after walking the red carpet at this year’s Brit Awards. On Tuesday night, the chart-topping star posed for photographers on her way into the event, where she was nominated for four awards, including the coveted Album Of The Year. However, rather than her outfit, it was a particular piece of jewellery that caught fans’ attention, prompting some to speculate that Adele could be engaged to her boyfriend, sports manager Rich Paul.

Earlier this week, Adele indirectly shot down speculation that her relationship with Rich was on the rocks, with a low-key message on social media. In an Instagram post announcing she was planning to perform at the Brits and appear on Graham Norton’s talk show while in London, she joked: “Oh, and Rich sends his love.” Adele and Rich were first linked in the press back in July after they attended the 2021 NBA Finals together. A few months later, the Easy On Me singer confirmed the romance when she shared a snap of herself and Rich posing together in a photo booth at the wedding of NBA star Anthony Davis. Speaking about her relationship in an interview with Vogue last year, Adele said: “I did date before Rich, but they hated it. They’d find it stressful being out or seen with me, which meant that I guarded all of it beyond. It never evolved because we were never experiencing things together. Whereas he’s not frazzled by it at all. “It feels like it’s consistent and considerate enough that I don’t care who knows… he’s great. He’s so f**kng funny. He’s so smart, you know.” Adele was previously married to charity boss Simon Konecki for three years, before announcing their split in April 2019. The former couple share a nine-year-old son, Angelo.
