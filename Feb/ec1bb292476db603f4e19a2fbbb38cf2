With dry January finally done and dusted we can get back to enjoying our favourite alcoholic drinks. If you’re a big cocktail fan, finding a good cocktail bar can be overwhelming. There are hundreds to choose from all over the country, but which one will serve the best mojito or porn star martini? Lucky for us, the list of the 2022 Top 50 Cocktail Bars has been released. The experimental Lab 22, found in the heart of Wales, takes the top spot after jumping up 32 places in two years thanks to its daring drinks menu from award-winning head bartender Max Hayward. The list also features bars such as London’s Swift Soho, which is number two on the list, and The Connaught Bar coming in third place, which was also voted number one in the 2021 World’s 50 Best Bars awards.  Other bars include Pennyroyal, which is situated Cardiff, ranking at number 36. It’s known for its friendly neighbourhood vibe and bold, eccentric cocktails.  The bars on the list are voted for by hundreds of experts, bartenders, bar owners and drinks writers. On the hunt for a new cocktail bar? Keep reading.  1. Lab 22, Cardiff 2. Swift Soho, London 3.
