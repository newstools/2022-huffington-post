Vladimir Putin may have led his troops into Ukraine in an unprovoked attack, but not everyone in Russia backs him. The Russian president declared war on his western neighbour early on Thursday morning, calling for all Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms – while alleging that Ukraine is response for all “possible bloodshed” and that Russia invaded by “necessity”. Putin also claimed that Ukraine has no right to exist as an independent country, and that its sovereignty was unsustainable, while warning the West and Nato that crossing Russia would mean facing “consequences greater than any you have faced in history”. However, it seems not everyone in Russia feels the same. Protests gathering in St Petersburg suggest the public are pushing back against Putin’s agenda – even though there is a total ban on protests and there have been reports of arrests. It looks like protesters against Putin's war are gathering in St Petersburg https://t.co/bs7M9VUFoc Some Russians are protesting Putin's attack on Ukraine despite a total ban on protesting and immediate heavy crackdowns from riot police. Here's a gathering of about 200 in St Petersburg https://t.co/i5LpMZIPCm Пушкинская сейчас. Полицейские говорят «гулять в другом месте».

Still, according to the FT’s Moscow bureau chief Max Seddon, just speaking out against state action can “get you banned from state TV for life”. It’s too early to say what the Russian people make of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, but he’s already lost a few celebrities. Most of these guys rely heavily on the state for their living.A short thread.
