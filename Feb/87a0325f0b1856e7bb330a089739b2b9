The show that we all hate to love is coming to an end. Season two of Love Is Blind has been a ride and we’ve been throughly entertained by the tweets about the drama. When it comes to reality TV show, social media can really add to the watching experience. It’s nice to know that I’m not the only one who found Sal’s ukulele playing annoying. And I’m sure I’m not the only one who cringed every time Shake said he didn’t find Deeps attractive. Even though there’s humour in the show, there are also some life lessons to learn. How important is religion in a relationship, is it a deal breaker? What do you do if your partner still has gifts from their ex, is that a red flag? This season has given us laughs and interesting perspectives on love. So, ahead of the final, here are our favourite tweets about season two of Love Is Blind. Shake’s mom is the only person on love is blind that isn’t delusional #loveisblind pic.twitter.com/34uzdq9MpT Not Shaina talking about faith and coveting another woman’s husband #Loveisblind pic.twitter.com/EVqtIaw8zB The love bombing and trauma bonding on Love is Blind is heavyyyyyyyy I really hope Nick says no because he’s going to spend his entire marriage apologizing for Danielle’s insecurities. Choose your peace King #LoveIsBlind pic.twitter.com/cPMaC46MhZ Every time Sal sings on Love is Blind. pic.twitter.com/rgk04panFT WHY is Danielle’s family so interested in her sex life? Nobody at that table, esp her brother, needs to ask “how’s your sex life?” #LoveIsBlind pic.twitter.com/oiF6Unv8V7 Let’s be real, Shake isn’t attracted to Deeps because he is being confronted with his internalized racism. You aren’t physically attracted to her because you equate beauty with Eurocentrism, and it’s EVIDENT. Like to say she reminds you of your aunt??? Really?? #LoveIsBlind pic.twitter.com/csLykC71Mj I’m glad Iyanna’s mom asked Jarrett what does he really love about her, because Iyanna being a “strong black woman” isn’t going to cut it! If a man tells you he loves you solely because you’re resilient & handle adversity well, he’s about to take you through it. #LoveIsBlind Iyanna is walking around wearing the gold ring Jarrett got for Mallory…IM SICK #loveisblind pic.twitter.com/rpt5plWnvw Love Is Blind season 3 needs to secretly match these people up with therapists instead #LoveIsBlind pic.twitter.com/ZOfLHzWvFI Official Love is Blind stance as of ep 5 I will not be taking questions #loveisblind2 #LoveIsBlind pic.twitter.com/owqfihTfhu #loveisblind2 Season two of #LoveIsBlind with no context: pic.twitter.com/eqEWguWJmL The #LoveIsBlind cast drowning in gold wine glasses: pic.twitter.com/PxHUNpxdnB If religion was such a big deal to Shaina, that should have been her FIRST question to every guy in the pods, and she should've eliminated whoever wasn't Christian #LoveIsBlind #loveisblind2 #LoveIsBlindS2
