Former vaccines minister minister Nadhim Zahawi has told how Covid left him struggling to breathe and with a temperature of 39.5 degrees. The education secretary said his doctor told him he would have been “in big trouble” if he hadn’t had both his jabs and a booster. Zahawi said the “horrific” virus, which he contracted two weeks ago, had nearly required him to be intubated in hospital. He told Sky News: “Certainly if I hadn’t had the vaccine I would have been in big trouble, according to my doctor.” The minister, who appeared to have lost weight, said he had been affected “quite severely” by the virus. He said: “By day four or five it got into my chest and it started really affecting my breathing and I was put on heavy medication. ″[My doctor] said one more day and I might have to put you onto steroids or something else that is heavier, but luckily I started to then recover. “My temperature went up to 39.5. It was not pleasant.” Zahawi, who led the government campaign to get the country vaccinated, added: ”[My doctor] reminded me that if I hadn’t had the vaccines and the booster, I guarantee you would have been in hospital and probably intubated. “Get your vaccine and get your booster, it’s never too late - the offer is evergreen from the NHS. “This thing is not like a cold, it’s not like a mild flu. If it hits you severely and you’re one of the unlucky ones, it’s horrific, it’s not good.” "I promise you, this thing is not like a cold"@nadhimzahawi urges people to get their covid vaccines & boosters as he talks of his own "horrific" experience with the virus 👇👇#KayBurley #AskTheEducationSecretary wx pic.twitter.com/Oq4cSuGYIV The Cabinet minister spoke out the day after Boris Johnson announced that England’s Covid restrictions will be lifted a month early.
