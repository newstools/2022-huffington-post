Dancing On Ice viewers were left howling during Sunday night’s live show after host Phillip Schofield suffered a bit of a presenting gaffe. After each of the remaining celebrities had performed, Phil sat down to speak to a few of them about their routines, before throwing to co-host Holly Willoughby, who was downstairs in the studio with the celebs’ friends and family. Unfortunately, though, it seemed she wasn’t quite camera-ready at that moment. When Phillip introduced his colleague with a Claudia Winkleman-esque “Holly!”, there were two seconds of awkward silence, before Holly was heard whispering off-screen: “No!” “Oh!” Schofe then piped up, before realising he was actually supposed to have been introducing a pre-recorded VT about next week’s episode. “You’re alright,” he then shouted down. “Stand down!” The blunder certainly tickled Dancing On Ice viewers, who were watching the show live over the weekend… @dancingonice is it just me who’s howling at when @Schofe goes to cut to @hollywills & she goes “no!” 🤣🤣🤣 sake phillip, NAW MAN!!!🤦🏻‍♀️🤣🙌🏼 #DancingOnIce pic.twitter.com/BkDlMXk1EB Phillip: Holly?Holly:#dancingonice pic.twitter.com/JpyS0jEaob also the tiny “…no!” from Holly when Phil tried to pass to her at the wrong time <3 #dancingonice That was so funny 😂💀 @Schofe "over to Holly" @hollywills " NO" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That told you Phil! 😂 #no #dancingonice @hollywills @schofe Phil: Holly...Holly: ...No. #DancingOnIce pic.twitter.com/odY88nvZcY Haha, even the veteran presenters can mess up sometimes!

For the second week in a row, The Vamps musician Connor Ball took a tumble on the ice during his live performance, with his latest accident leaving him needing stitches in his leg when he cut himself with the blade of his ice skate. Meanwhile, Coronation Street legend Sally Dynevor became the sixth celebrity to leave the competition at the end of the episode. She landed in the bottom two alongside Olympian Kye Whyte, who managed to survive his third skate-off when all four judges opted to save him. Dancing On Ice continues on Sunday night at 6.30pm on ITV.
