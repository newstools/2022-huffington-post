Six meaningful conversations, three long walks and two barnstorming rows every month – that’s the recipe for a perfect relationship, according to new research. A survey asked 2,000 happily married couples about the inner workings of their relationship and found the most contented placed high importance on trying new things together, going on weekends away, and turning a blind eye when the other person is being moody or annoying. Happy couples also valued listening to each other grumble about work, showing the other how proud you are of them, and being respectful in front of others. The research, commissioned by Warner Leisure Hotels, resulted in a list of the 50 – yep, you read right – elements that are supposedly key to a happy relationship. A fair distribution of household chores paves the way for a successful union, according to the findings, as does being able to laugh with each other after an argument. Researchers found that 63% of happily married adults place a lot of importance on their other half behaving romantically, with one in five impressed with the larger gestures like booking a trip away. However, 36% are also content with the smaller acts of kindness such as dinner out every now and then. And almost four in 10 consider everyday gestures such as putting the bins out as romantic. Pursuing your own hobbies and interests, allowing your other half to see you at your worst, and being silly with each other were also all valued highly. The list also promotes that age-old adage, “never go to bed on an argument”, and includes a reminder to always offer your partner a brew when you’re putting the kettle on for yourself.
