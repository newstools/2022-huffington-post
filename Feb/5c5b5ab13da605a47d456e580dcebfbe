Adele may be the biggest music star in the world right now, but she can still party with the best of them, as she proved at London’s Heaven nightclub on Thursday.  The Easy On Me singer was seen having a lovely old time at the LGBTQ+ night G-A-Y in a series of videos that stunned fans shared on social media.  After recording an appearance on The Graham Norton Show – which is set to air on Friday and will see her address her rumoured engagement to boyfriend Rich Paul – Adele hotfooted it in to central London to party.  She even joined RuPaul’s Drag Race UK queen Cheryl Hole on stage to judge the club’s regular Porn Idol contest.  Adele was seen getting her absolute life to Geri Halliwell’s version of It’s Raining Men, complete with what we think might have been her attempt at a death drop... adele partying at a gay bar has me on the floor 😭😭 pic.twitter.com/f8eakVCl6I And getting down to Ce Ce Peniston’s Finally...

In her Graham Norton interview, she said she is “working her arse off” to reschedule the dates, and that it will “100% happen this year”.  After the show, Cheryl couldn’t quite take in what had happened that night, tweeting: “I’m sorry, not @Adele turning up at my show tonight,” adding a crying emoji.  Along with pics of her with the superstar, Cheryl joked of her recent Drag Race UK vs The World elimination: “Confirmed: @Adele was devastated I was eliminated on Drag Race too. Love you divalina.” I’m sorry, not @Adele turning up at my show tonight 😭 Confirmed: @Adele was devastated I was eliminated on Drag Race too. Love you divalina 💖 pic.twitter.com/GyY8U5sqtQ
