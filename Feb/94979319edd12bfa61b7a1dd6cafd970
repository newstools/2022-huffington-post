Saturday Night Live viewers were moved to tears following the US show’s tribute to Ukraine at the start of this weekend’s programme. At the beginning of Saturday’s show, hosts Kate McKinnon and Cecily Strong introduced the Ukrainian Chorus Dumka of New York, who performed a moving rendition of Prayer for Ukraine. Kyiv was spelled out in candles on a table just in front of the choir. Watch the clip above. Following the moving scenes, viewers praised the show for the ‘haunting’ and ‘majestic’ show opener… Anybody else burst into tears while watching the cold open of #SNL?#Ukraine If you missed it, this is was the #SNL cold open to the show tonight … and it was absolutely MAJESTIC!  🇺🇦🌻 #StandWithUkriane #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/vEyJI7Dpcy Very moving and respectful tribute to Ukraine and Kyiv tonight on SNL. #SNL What a remarkable way to open the show  #SNL #Ukraine 🇺🇦 pic.twitter.com/v83PPiHd2E Omg!  @nbcsnl!
