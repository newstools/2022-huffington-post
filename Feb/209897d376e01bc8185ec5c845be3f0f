FYI, Valentine’s Day is rapidly approaching (you didn’t know?) and while it’s easy to assume this celebration of love is only for the partnered up, it’s also an opportunity to celebrate your best gal pals.  Even if you totally despise V-day (super relatable and understandable, btw), it doesn’t need to stop you celebrating your ride-or-die women and Galentine’s Day – traditionally celebrated on February 13 – is the perfect opportunity to show them just how much you value them. Admittedly, ‘Galentine’s’ is a cheesy concept, too, but let’s be honest here – everything about Valentine’s is cheesy. And cheese can be good, especially when it comes to the people you love.  So, whether you go low-key with a simple card or throw a full-on bash for your BFF, Galentine’s is the ideal day to do it. And we’ve compiled the ultimate gift guide to help you out.
