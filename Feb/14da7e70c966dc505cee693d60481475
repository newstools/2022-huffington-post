Energy regulator Ofgem has just announced a staggering increase in energy prices, leaving people absolutely outraged at No.10 – again. Energy bills will rise by up to £693 (54%) per year for each household from April, adding to the cost of living crisis, in England, Wales and Scotland. It means consumers could pay closer to £1,971 on average for their yearly gas and electricity bills and close to six million people could be soon be facing fuel poverty. Downing Street has promised some financial help will be available to offset the staggering increase – but the public are still furious. A few people have pointed out that Boris Johnson promised the UK would be able to secure lower gas and electricity bills if the country left the EU when he was campaigning for Brexit back in 2016. Others have suggested all the other ways the government could have tackled the rising wholesale gas prices without impacting the cost of living, such as cutting VAT. Really not hyperbolic to say this will tip so, so many people into poverty. Absolutely awful news. https://t.co/a1OiaEnwri People will not be able to cope. https://t.co/TmC9Kb6uU6 It's true, isn't it? The Tories claim to be the party of low tax, but, one way or another, under the Tories ordinary people get hammered by tax and VAT, high prices, low pay and reduced support. The Tories cost you more and deliver less, every single time. Oh. pic.twitter.com/qTWLdV8CMR April showers won’t be cheap. The sudden surge in the cost of heating will hit families across the country just as the new NI tax kicks in. People need control of their lives by having control of their wallets - that’s why lower taxes matter for every home. https://t.co/3X7ggWendp Jesus this is brutal. https://t.co/qoqF2OFCmO Yet more truth from the man nobody in parliament is allowed to call a liar pic.twitter.com/6MRwUAnEI3 Don’t worry             Fuck youabout it                    pay me pic.twitter.com/BI96MoWhFn So we’re clear…Johnson is praising Brexit for enabling us to cut VAT on gas and electricity But refuses to cut VAT on gas and electric While EU country Spain has already cut VAT on gas and electricity But what *is* sustainable is having to choose between heating and eating. https://t.co/eQgZadrKWf £700 extra on gas bill is a disaster. But the gas cap rise is political decision, not some force of nature. Gov't could halt it, levy windfall tax on super-profits, bring failing suppliers into public ownership. Instead they prioritise profits over living standards. Seriously, how tf are we going to afford this? pic.twitter.com/05HlLHItGm A reminder that is already the case that 1.5m people cannot afford enough food to eat regular meals. https://t.co/RvZr4veUf7 An idea - how about the energy company shareholders taking a hit for a change? Government announces support for rising energy costs. For example if you’re a fraudster they’ll simply write it off. To add insult to injury, the prime minister released a promotional video on Twitter at almost the exact same time about his “Levelling Up the UK” campaign. It didn’t quite read the room, to say the least. my guy putting this out the same time Ofgem increases its price cap by 54% https://t.co/HbPXQr5IXb
