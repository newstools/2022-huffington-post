Stacey Solomon has officially joined the Great British Bake Off family as the new co-host of The Professionals spin-off.  The Loose Women panellist and former X Factor star will join Liam Charles at the helm of the next series, which sees teams of master bakers competing.  It appears Stacey – who recently welcomed her daughter Rose with fiancé Joe Swash – is replacing comedian Tom Allen, who has hosted the series with Liam since it moved to Channel 4 from BBC Two in 2018.  The news was announced in a tweet sent from the official Bake Off Twitter account, which also confirmed Benoit Blin and Cherish Finden will return as judges for the upcoming seventh season. Choux la la!

Meanwhile, a new Stand Up To Cancer series featuring a batch of new celebrity contestants is set to air this spring.  The likes of Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse, presenter Emma Willis, Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo and Olympian Mo Farrah will all be putting their culinary skills to the test in the tent. Bake Off host Matt Lucas was also drafted in to compete as a contestant after a celeb was forced to drop out at the last minute.
