Loose Women panellist Jane Moore has come under fire after penning a newspaper column suggesting young people be “posted to the Ukrainian border with Russia” to gain some perspective. The daytime star and journalist penned a column in The Sun on Wednesday, with the headline: “OK kids, let’s see how you deal with REAL problems – like a posting to Ukraine’s frontline.” Within the column, Jane lambasted Gen Z, writing: “Perhaps, in the spirit of the superb TV show Wife Swap, we could film Strife Swap, where any noisy rabble-rousers bleating about how terrible the UK is could change places with someone for whom life in this country would rightly feel like nirvana by comparison. “For episode one, a bunch of Gen Zs might be torn away from their war on free speech in our universities for a lesson in how so many young lads their age fought in the Second World War precisely so they could enjoy the freedom they have today.” She continued: “Perhaps a posting to the Ukrainian border with Russia might help them to understand the fear of racing down a deadly force that might kill you? Here’s a gun, kids. You have a choice – kill or get killed.” The column was met with an immediate backlash on social media, with many highlighting that, with no military experience of her own, it was distasteful to use the situation in Ukraine as “fodder” for a “culture war”. Some critics also pointed out national service had already been abolished by the time Jane was born in 1962. Others questioned whether, as the mother of teenagers, Jane would be happy for them to be put in the imaginary scenario proposed in her column.

He doesn't talk about it, other than that he saw and experienced things no one should and I think it affected his mental health profoundly. He certainly never wanted it for any of us. Fuck right off.1⃣ Ukraine's peril isn't fodder for your culture war on people you decided are less equipped to handle war than you baselessly fantasize you are. 2⃣ Shit like this undermines support for Ukraine by wrongly implying British kids may be sent to fight there. pic.twitter.com/y3RosQpbSM Before my father died at the age of ninety he told me that one of the things he was happiest about was that none of his children or grandchildren had ever been called to go to war. But what did he know he only served for 6 years in destroyers. And his father was disabled from WW1 that would be loose women presenter jane moore recounting her wartime experience would it? pic.twitter.com/NyAfyW5Bac Jane Moore who famously fought in the trenches of World War One pic.twitter.com/RT1QpqLsKF Jane Moore, was born in 1962, two years after the end of conscription.

After stepping down a year later, she returned in 2013, and has remained part of the show in the nine years since.
