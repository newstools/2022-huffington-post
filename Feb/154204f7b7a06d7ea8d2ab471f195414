Jamal was one of the nicest, most down to earth and humble men I’ve met in this industry. He always gave me time even when no one else would. pic.twitter.com/0ILKrIXtxH Jamal was a teenager when he launched the youth broadcasting and production film channel SB.TV to upload clips he had recorded of his friends performing on the estate where he lived in Acton, west London. He was also an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, a charity headed by the Prince of Wales, and in 2014 he was awarded an MBE for his services to music. Speaking to PA after being made an MBE, he said he started SB.TV to give his friends a platform. He said: “It was a frustration of going to school and everyone talking about ‘how do we get our videos on MTV’. “YouTube was like a year old. I was like ‘I’ve got a camera for Christmas, I’m going to start filming people and uploading it’.
