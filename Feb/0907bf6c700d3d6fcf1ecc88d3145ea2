Alexandra Burke has revealed she is expecting her first child with her footballer boyfriend Darren Randolph. The former X Factor winner shared the news in a video on Instagram, which showed her revealing her baby bump. She captioned the video, “Due June 2022.” The clip shows the 33-year-old singer and the football star out on a country walk with their two dogs.
