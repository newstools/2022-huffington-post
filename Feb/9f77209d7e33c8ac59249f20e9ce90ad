50 Cent quite literally dropped in to the Super Bowl LVI halftime show and fans were not prepared. The rapper — who was not on the pre-released lineup of Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige and Eminem — gave a surprise performance of his iconic 2003 hit In Da Club, appearing hanging upside down from a ceiling in a callback to the song’s music video.  Wow. @50cent #PepsiHalftime pic.twitter.com/8UlJW57gEX It’s not a real Super Bowl halftime show unless it produces some stellar memes and tweets, and fans promptly obliged: 50 cent waiting for his turn during #HalfTimeShow pic.twitter.com/Y0OyTjSNks 50 Cent showing up to #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/Zmm2wrCrvi 50 Cent hanging there waiting for snoop like: #SuperBowl #HalfTimeShow pic.twitter.com/kGZQjAyX09 50 cent waiting for his part in the halftime show #SuperBowl pic.twitter.com/hWZaOp6N7p When 50 Cent came on pic.twitter.com/cRk0x4xFKP 50 cent pulled up to the halftime show like pic.twitter.com/n6eamtFkXa 50 cent after he finished his song #HalfTimeShow #PepsiHalftime pic.twitter.com/1XlB8ljopF When I saw 50 cent Upside Down 🤩🤯 #HalfTimeShow pic.twitter.com/rCAXBM7LBF no one:50 cent:#HalfTimeShow pic.twitter.com/mtEsWMB6r2 Who the fuck signed off on letting 50 Cent be upside down.
