Every year when the Brit Awards roll around we find ourselves getting all nostalgic for past ceremonies – and the event from 20 years ago was a particular stand-out. In 2002, the Brits gave us some classic performances from top UK talent, some real A-list wins and a smorgasbord of some of the most blatantly early-noughties fashion you’re ever likely to clap eyes on. And that’s without even going into the top moment of the night, delivered by a certain Ms Minogue when she defined “making an entrance” with a Brits performance we’re still talking about two decades later. Here are just some of the highlights from the 2002 Brits... This year’s Brit Awards will air live on ITV from on Tuesday 8 February.
