Former Tory cabinet members have urged Priti Patel to guarantee Ukrainian refugees the right to live in the UK. George Osborne and Rory Stewart are among those supporting the move as thousands flee their country following the Russian invasion. Julian Smith, who was chief whip under Theresa May, urged the Home Office to rip up existing asylum rules in light of the crisis. In a tweet on Saturday afternoon, he said: “It’s really important that the United Kingdom makes an immediate open, welcoming & warm hearted commitment of sanctuary to those who wish to leave Ukraine. Rip up the usual bureaucracy & let’s just say they are welcome & we will make it as easy as possible to be here.” It's really important that the United Kingdom makes an immediate open, welcoming & warm hearted commitment of sanctuary to those who wish to leave Ukraine.
