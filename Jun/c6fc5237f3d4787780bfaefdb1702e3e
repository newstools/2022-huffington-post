And the more traffic (in other words people) filing through it, the worse chance there is of a mishap. We’re talking scribbles on the walls, stains on the carpet and spills just about anywhere. Nice furnishings are hard enough to come by without the thought of having to replace them, especially with the cost of living on the constant rise. Be it wine, pee, sweat, blood, oil, ink, grass or really any red tomato-based sauce, it’s impossible to avoid spillages. But we’ve rounded up these highly-approved stain removers from Amazon so that you can clean up rather than chuck stuff out.
