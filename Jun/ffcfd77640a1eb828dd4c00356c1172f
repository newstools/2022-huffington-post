RMT’s general-secretary Mick Lynch replied: “Well, they were around for a very long time.” There was a smattering of laughter, before the audience member hit back with: ″[But] they’re not with us now though, are they?” Woman on question time says train drivers must adapt to technology because the dinosaurs didn’t and “look what happened to them” I’m howling pic.twitter.com/KlVSIcxEXT While condemning the strike action, Network Rail has accused the RMT – the union leading the strikes – of pushing back against modernisation essential to the industry. However, Lynch has denied these claims, saying: “We’re not resisting change. We negotiate change on a permanent basis with our employers...What we’ve got here is an unreasonable agenda of pay cuts and slashing terms and conditions.” But, to return to the viral clip, it seems not many people were sure where this audience member was coming from... does she think they should have negotiated with the meteor If only the dinosaurs hadn't unionised then they might have lasted longer than 165 million years https://t.co/K17So4InOR those wanker unionised dinosaurs. https://t.co/m32Ob6Ir1d Did... did she kill all the dinosaurs https://t.co/mYwQPitt9z
