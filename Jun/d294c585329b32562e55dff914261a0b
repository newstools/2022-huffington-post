Prince William celebrated his 40th birthday on Tuesday with well-wishes and photos from the British royal family.  The Duke of Cambridge was born to Prince Charles and Princess Diana on June 21, 1982, at 9:03pm at St Mary’s Hospital in London.  The Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, released a message for William’s big day on Tuesday via their social media accounts, which included four photos of the father and son together.  “Wishing The Duke of Cambridge a very happy 40th birthday,” the message read, alongside birthday cake and balloon emojis.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge released a new photo two days ago to mark Father’s Day. The photo shows William grinning alongside his three children: George, Charlotte and Louis. The photo was taken during the family’s visit to Jordan last year. The foursome were pictured in the same outfits they wore in a photo released for their 2021 Christmas card.
