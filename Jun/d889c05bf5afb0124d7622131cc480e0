There’s nothing like settling down in front of the box to watch some telly with your nearest and dearest. Except when things get a little raunchy on screen, which is exactly what happened to many of our Celebrity Gogglebox favourites during Friday night’s show when they watched the not-exactly-wholesome Fifty Shades Of Grey. Rylan went for the cushion-in-front-of-his-face approach as his mum Linda enquired about some of the errrm, props, used in the movie. What’s a flogger? @Rylan #FiftyShadesOfGrey #CelebrityGogglebox pic.twitter.com/Tw2XjHm6Xn “What’s a flogger?” she asked her groaning son. “Summink they cross the arse with or summink?” Things you don’t want to hear your mum say… @Rylan #LoveIsland #CelebrityGogglebox pic.twitter.com/wdLdbmycCj Oh Linda, never change. Zoe Ball was finding the whole experience equally cringeworthy, having to sit and watch the BDSM-themed movie with not only her son, Woody, but also her dad, Johnny.

He definitely meant ASMR. We think. And as for Clare Balding and her wife Alice, there wasn’t a curled-up toe in sight… Maybe he likes horses #FiftyShadesOfGrey #CelebrityGogglebox pic.twitter.com/ZgbbTQHZux Celebrity Gogglebox airs Fridays at 9pm on Channel 4 and All4.
