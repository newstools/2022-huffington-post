While most people love summer (hello sunny days, cocktails, and beach breaks), for those of us with oily skin, navigating the season can be tricky.  In the warmer summer months, when the temperatures and humidity levels increase, our skin naturally produces more sebum, which can lead to skin looking (and feeling) even oilier than usual.  I struggle with oil-prone skin all year long, but in the warmer months, I used to have a constant slick coating my face. While oily skin is nothing to be ashamed of, it can be super uncomfortable to live with, especially when it makes your skin feel greasy. Sigh.  The good news is that there are lots of great products that can make navigating summer skin oiliness (and keeping the slick at bay) a hell of a lot easier.  To help you take back control of your skin, I’ve rounded up a selection of my holy grails for managing oily skin throughout the summer months and beyond.
