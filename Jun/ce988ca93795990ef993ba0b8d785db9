Jeff Goldblum has recalled the time he shared popcorn with Princess Diana at a special screening of the first Jurassic Park film, almost 30 years ago. Although he didn’t reveal if the treat was salty or sweet, the actor did describe Diana as a “spectacular lady” after they were seated next to one another at the showing at London’s Natural History Museum. The Hollywood star was joined by his fellow cast members including Sam Neill and Richard Attenborough at the event in 1993. Recalling the premiere of Jurassic Park, he told Entertainment Tonight: “I’m remembering London. “We showed it to – speaking of the Jubilee, the Platinum Jubilee – we showed it to Princess Diana and we had a kind of a royal screening. “Sam Neil was here, Princess Diana was here, you know, and we showed them the movie.” “I was standing there next to Diana… sitting, with popcorn. He added: “I was very much a gentleman and she was a spectacular lady.” Jeff isn’t the only star who has memories of sitting next to Diana at a film premiere. Michael J Fox found himself in just that situation back in 1985, when Diana plonked herself down next to him at the world premiere of his movie, Back To The Future. But instead of pinching himself, all the then-24-year-old Michael could do was cross his legs. .@realmikefox reveals that he once watched #BackToTheFuture next to Princess Diana! 🍿 #FallonTonight pic.twitter.com/qOUiH41VTk “She was sitting next to me. The lights go down and the movie starts and I realise I am one fake yawn and an arm stretch away from being on a date with her, which is hilarious,” Michael recalled. “The movie started and also I had to go pee. So for the rest of the movie, I’m sitting there like dying. I can’t say anything to her and I can’t walk away from her because I can’t turn my back on her.” The star added: “So it was just agony. What could have been the greatest night of my life was a nightmare. A pee-holding nightmare.”
