Anyone who lives in the UK knows our personalities centre around the weather. Considering it rains a high percentage of the time in this country of ours, it only make sense. So when a heatwave decides to appear out of nowhere the whole country starts buzzing. With what emotion, however, depends on your weather temperament. When it’s sunny, everything can feel more manageable. It’s easier to get outside, and you generally feel more alive. But not everyone enjoys being in a heatwave, especially when we have to work through one. Either way, everyone has thoughts around the high temperatures this week and here’s what they are. working in a kitchen when there’s a heatwave is not it Shout out to all the people working in the heat especially construction men 🫶🏼 Happy 1 day heatwave Enjoy it ya lucky bastards, working in a 40+ degree factory promises to be a dream of a day 😵‍💫 Britain’s main defence against a heatwave: pic.twitter.com/blzAtyaJdv I wish the UK had hot weather all the time.
