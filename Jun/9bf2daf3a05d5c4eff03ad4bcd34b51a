But if you’re unlucky enough to be stuck at your desk, on your commute, or in a house or flat that seems to get hotter by the minute, your summery mood can easily turn. Brits love to moan about the cold, but as soon as the temperature rises, we start complaining about that, too. Heat can make you drowsy, irritated, restless and uncomfortable, especially when it feels impossible to cool down. We know that feeling and it can totally derail your day or night. But we don’t want the sun to go away – we just want to be free to enjoy it. Which is why we’ve rounded up some brilliant buys that people swear by to help them beat the heat and stay cool and comfortable all summer long.
