Black excellence took centre stage at the 2022 BET Awards on Sunday night to celebrate achievements in music, culture and sports.  In the lead-up to the ceremony, Doja Cat led the way in the nominations with six nods, while Ari Lennox and Drake each had four. On the night, it was US rapper and producer Anderson .Paak who came out on top, bagging two awards as part of Silk Sonic and another for his work as a music video director. Meanwhile, Kendrick Lamar scooped two awards for Best Hip-Hop Artist and Video Of The Year. He was not present at the ceremony as it coincided with his headlining performance at Glastonbury. Also on two wins was King Richard, with Will Smith being awarded Best Actor and the film itself being named Best Movie. The night’s highest honour went to Sean “Diddy” Combs, who received the lifetime achievement award at the show, following last year’s winner Queen Latifah. The prestigious award is granted each year to industry giants who have “significantly shaped culture through their extensive careers” and “been transformative leaders that consistently inspire generations by setting a true standard of excellence”.
