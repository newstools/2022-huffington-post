The country’s favourite dating show is back and we’re hooked to our TVs again. Love Island has proved once more that it’s the show that keeps on giving. Just two episodes into the new season and already, the public has some strong opinions. So far, we’ve watched the Italian stallion Davide pair up with Gemma. And some viewers were shocked, considering the fact that Davide is 27 years old and Gemma is only 19. The pairing sparked conversations around age gaps in relationships and whether it’s appropriate for a 19-year old to be dating someone who is eight years their senior. There are so many reasons why Gemma (19) and Davide (27) is an inappropriate match, but nothing is ickier than seeing people justify it with things like "u wouldn't say the same if she was 25 and he was 33" No, because he pre-frontal cortex would be fully developed #LoveIsland Davide picking Gemma has given me serious ick. She was 16 when the pandemic started 🤮 #LoveIsland People saying “what about Laura and Wes” are very sus to me cus like ok, that was a problem too and IF it wasn’t called out as much it should’ve been. But that doesn’t mean Gemma and Davide are ok!! Like are you just arguing for the sake of it? It’s a weird age gap! #LoveIsland It’s weirding me out that Gemma was 16 at the start of the pandemic. Like fresh out of the GCSE exam hall, barely old enough to buy a Red Bull. Davide was at least 24-25 🥴 #LoveIsland pic.twitter.com/t18hh9OBOI Is everybody forgetting the 9 year age gap between Wes and Laura in 2018. Why is everybody crying over an 8 year age gap between Gemma and Davide. #LoveIsland2022 #LoveIsland People are quick to comment on the age gap between gemma and Davide, however fail to remember the age gap between Wes & Laura .. okay #LoveIsland Love island should be 21+ tbh , what business does a 19 year old have kissing a 27 year old ??? when will love island get a 21+ rule cos seeing this lass straight out of sixth form is WEIRD  #loveisland #gemmaowen pic.twitter.com/95vVPw6YVr sorry but am i the only one who thinks love island contestants should be 21+… idk there’s just something so uncomfy to me about a 19 y/o being on this show…🤠 #LoveIslandUK let’s be honest davide and gemma are both legal so… #LoveIsland The fact that Davide could be getting labelled a nonce if he picks a legal aged Gemma (19) is just mind-blowing. #loveisland Everyone hating on Gemma just because she’s 19, leave the girl alone! She’s a legal adult, she can do what she wants. People just jealous #LoveIsland This is not love island this is Year 12 common room  #Loveisland
