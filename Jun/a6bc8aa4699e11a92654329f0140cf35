As the Queen took centre stage on the first day of her historic Platinum Jubilee celebrations, social media was ready and waiting. Thousands of well-wishers packed onto The Mall in central London as the monarch emerged on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the special flypast after Trooping the Colour. It marked the start of the special extended Jubilee weekend marking her 70-year-reign. While television broadcasters went with a celebration of the pomp and pageantry, Twitter was offering a different perspective on “Platty Jubes”. people say the royal family are out of touch but Prince Louis really understands how the nation feels about the #PlatinumJubilee pic.twitter.com/NuPdYIpWiA Horse Guards Parade. Man singing lustily in an England ‘96 shirt, six pack in one hand, fag in another. Union Jack billowing behind him, Tesco crown on his head. The lion roars. Just some full size knitted Queens with and without faces pic.twitter.com/HopeElpIBS Husband has just seen four men doing a line of coke OUTSIDE some toilets at 9.30 am in Doncaster.  Happy Platty Joobs peeps.🇬🇧 The wonderful thing about the Platinum Jubilee weekend is that I might get a chance to regrout the bathroom floor. The year is 2022… and a BBC presenter and someone from the British Army are explaining why “micks” actually isn’t an offensive term for Irish people… 🙄🤦‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/OZpfwOmAAP “I just don’t get it…”             - Stacey Solomon. ☕️ #Jubilee #JubileeWeekend pic.twitter.com/9jYP7ykojQ https://t.co/isc1EmdjM8 pic.twitter.com/S7l9cEFjI9 https://t.co/mpKj8S9r2K pic.twitter.com/uqLCGJRjVN
