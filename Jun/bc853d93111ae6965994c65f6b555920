The drought is almost over. Six years after the release of her seminal album Lemonade, Beyoncé has confirmed she’s got new music coming in a matter of weeks. On Thursday morning, the music legend announced her seventh album Renaissance (subtitled “Act I” on her official website) would be coming on 29 July. Needless to say, the stir quickly caused a huge stir on social media, with Beyoncé and Renaissance both quickly rising up the list of global trending topics on Twitter.
