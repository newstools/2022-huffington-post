After five years together and eight months since they got engaged, Britney Spears and her partner Sam Asghari finally got hitched on Thursday. After 13 years of being unable to tie the knot because of her hugely restrictive conservatorship, which she was finally freed from in November last year, the singer walked down the aisle at a lavish bash held at her home in California. And this being Britney, it wasn’t any old wedding. Here’s all the details from the newlyweds big day… The 28-year-old is of Persian heritage, and moved to the US with his family from Iran. He works as a model, personal trainer, and actor. The couple first laid eyes on each other when Sam played her love interest in her Slumber Party video in 2016. Britney and Sam’s nuptials took place in the grounds of her huge, five-bedroom Italian villa in Thousand Oaks, California. The singer arrived in a Cinderella-inspired fairytale horse-drawn carriage. Katie Price did the same when she married Peter Andre in 2005 (pictured above). We had high hopes that Britney would choose her 1999 hit Born To Make You Happy to walk down the aisle to, but instead the couple chose Elvis Presley’s classic, Can’t Help Falling In Love.

Donatella Versace, who was spotted meeting with the bride back in March, was one of the celebrity invitees. Donatella told Access that creating the dress had been “a lot of fun, a lot of emotion” before adding: “I wish them the best, they’re amazing together, I’m so happy for them.” Britney paired her designer gown with jewellery by Stephanie Gottlieb and make-up by British make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury. As well as Donatella, Madonna, Paris Hilton (and her mum) and Drew Barrymore were among the 60 guests in attendance...

Missing from the action was Britney’s estranged father Jamie Spears, mother Lynne Spears and younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears. Their father, and Britney’s second husband, Kevin Federline told TMZ that their sons (above, pictured with Britney) were “happy for Britney and wish her and Sam all the best going forward.” Jason Alexander – who married Britney in 2004 only for it to be annulled after just 55 hours – was arrested after he live-streamed his attempt to “crash” the wedding on Instagram Live. After being tackled by Britney’s security, he was charged with two counts of misdemeanour battery, one count of misdemeanour vandalism and one count of misdemeanour trespassing following the incident.
