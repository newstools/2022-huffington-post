Before the Covid-19 pandemic, a cough was just a cough. Now, it’s a source of panic, dread and frantic looks from strangers – even glares.  Of course, it’s important to take a test if you suspect you might have Covid or start showing symptoms. But people also cough for a variety of reasons – allergies, asthma, the common cold or even just inhaling something you shouldn’t have. The same goes for other common Covid symptoms, like fatigue or headaches. Still, many of us are used to immediately offering a reason for coughing or sneezing every time it happens in public. And some have turned to Twitter to muse about this new (ish) reality. Below, we’ve rounded up 25 relatable tweets about the struggle of showing any symptoms in the age of Covid. trying to conceal my NOT COVID cough like it’s a zombie bite Is it omicron or delta or your period or a cold or flu or allergies or anxiety or long covid or perimenopause or food poisoning or migraine or a tumor (“it’s not a tumor”) or PTSD or parenting is just so hard lolol or too much sitting and screen time and stress or IS IT COVID or If people could stop cutting their grass so I don’t need to explain that I don’t have COVID thanks 🤧 - hayfever life 😫.. how do I explain that, no, it's not a covid cough, I just don't know how to swallow my own spit Covid symptoms are tough for me.
