Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Love Island is back, and once again we’re all low key obsessed. For the 2022 series, the show has moved to a whole new villa, and it’s safe to say that the contestants’ summer crib is giving us major vacay envy.  Boasting many Love Island trademarks, from the pool to the fire pit, the new villa is seriously gorgeous, and features some stunning bits of decor, too. One item that’s caught a lot of attention is one of the iconic outdoor sofas. You know the one – situated on the balcony, just outside the girls’ dressing room, where all the really juicy gossiping goes on. Well, believe it or not, it’s actually available to buy from Made.com and – as we write this – it’s still in stock.  The five seater Avarna sofa, which includes a handy coffee table, has proved to be surprisingly popular for the brand with sales rising by 223% since the latest season of the show launched.  The sofa is made from whitewashed acacia wood, with a plinth base and topped with nicely squishy cream cushions. The design is also super versatile and can be moved around into a range of shapes to fit most spaces. At £1,995, it doesn’t come cheap, but this is one piece of furniture that will see you through the years – and just think of the all the gossips you’ll have on it. Whether you want to style it up with the boho chic vibes in the picture below or you’d like to recreate the Love Island look with bright, bold scatter cushions, we think you’ll agree this sofa will look just glorious in your own pad.
