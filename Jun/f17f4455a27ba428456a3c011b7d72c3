Nadine Dorries has leapt to the defence of Boris Johnson after he received a bracing reception from the public at a Platinum Jubilee service – but the culture secretary’s loyalty appears to have been counter-productive. The prime minister faced boos – and a smattering of cheers – as he walked up the St Paul’s Cathedral steps with wife Carrie Johnson to attend the service of thanksgiving for the Queen on Friday. As BBC presenter Jane Hill, who was standing yards away, noted: “There is quite a lot of booing, actually. A substantial amount.” The Prime Minister @BorisJohnson arriving with wife Carrie at St Paul’s Cathedral for the Platinum Thanksgiving Service is booed by some in the crowd@BBCNews pic.twitter.com/rHbBgX8Jzh Boris Johnson was booed as he arrived at St. Paul's Cathedral on Friday for the queen's Platinum Jubilee celebration.

Because I’ve just come from @hayfestival, I wonder what it would be like to have a Culture Secretary who tweeted her support of extraordinary arts events like that, and hundreds of others, instead of this nonsense https://t.co/yvOyx2KAQf Genuine question; are you aware of the fact that other people can hear sounds That’s not what it sounds like on the footage I’ve seen. Some catcalls too https://t.co/GiNyy1X8Vn Tories 2021: "There was no booze"Tories 2022: "There were no boos" Remember, Dorries will be responsible for "tackling misinformation" under the new Online Safety Bill, with robust provisions for ministerial orders. https://t.co/yqEjWxuMKp
