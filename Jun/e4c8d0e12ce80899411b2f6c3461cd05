Woof – it’s been a long week. If you feel like you’ve been working like a dog, let us offer you the internet equivalent of a big pile of catnip: hilarious tweets about pets. We Shih Tzu not. Each week at HuffPost, we scour Twitter to find the funniest posts about our furballs being complete goofballs. They’re sure to make you howl. (And if you want some more, no need to beg – check out last week’s batch right here.) From now on when my dog needs to do her business, I’m going to ask her if she needs to go out and take a Ted Cruz. just found out my ottoman is destroyed because this man decided to turn it into a hammock pic.twitter.com/aNgA7AZKKP Because you want to see a doggy living its best life.  pic.twitter.com/PIQzc6gHup I can't stop thinking about this cat. I can't stop fucking laughing at how unfathomable fucking pissed off this creature is. The indignation. The furor. The ire. This cat truly embodied what it means to say ">:3" pic.twitter.com/GbRl7uYmJv This dog just gave birth to 2 puppies , this is her proud face ❤🥰 pic.twitter.com/XmPXP2cdhJ Cats know good people, even when they're made of bronze. pic.twitter.com/47PYsILmFO What a stage 11 clinger looks like pic.twitter.com/jHjHUuznOU Important annoucement: the kittens have discovered the top platform of the cat tree. pic.twitter.com/2FRpEJJ1Lt pic.twitter.com/Q1pLJ2QrRi it’s then replying to a picture of that dog for me pic.twitter.com/VK26rYj0Nf
