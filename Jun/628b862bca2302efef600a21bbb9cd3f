Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein will be charged with two counts of indecent assault against a woman in London in August 1996, the Crown Prosecution Service has said. The CPS confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that it had authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Weinstein with two counts of indecent assault against a woman in London in August 1996. Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said: “Charges have been authorised against Harvey Weinstein, 70, following a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against the defendant are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.” In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said that it is alleged the two offences took place between 31 July and 31 August 1996 and that the accuser is a woman who is now aged in her 50s. Weinstein is currently imprisoned in California and is awaiting trial on charges he assaulted five women in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills between 2004 and 2013. He was previously jailed for 23 years in New York for sexually assaulting a TV and film production assistant in 2006 and raping an aspiring actress in 2013. It is not yet clear what the route to Weinstein being extradited and facing a UK court would be.
