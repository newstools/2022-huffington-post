When the weather’s like this, we want to spend as much time outdoors as possible. Even as the sun starts to set, we’re hesitant to go inside, instead wanting to eek out the rest of our evenings while we can. Whether it’s afternoon barbecues that blend into dusky nights, movie viewings snuggled under the stars, or chilled out drinking sessions around a fire pit, it’s time to make the most of it. To help you with your setup for those evenings outdoors, we’ve rounded up a selection of buys that will seriously up your garden, balcony or backyard game.
