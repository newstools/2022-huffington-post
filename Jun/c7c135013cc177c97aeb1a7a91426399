Of the 11 acts to make it through to this year’s BGT finale – five of whom were chosen by the judges, alongside five selected by the public and one wildcard – Axel received an impressive 19.7% of votes cast on the night. His nearest competition was ventriloquist and second place finisher Jamie Leahey, who opened the show and received 14.7% of the final vote. Not far behind him were singer Tom Ball and opera performer Maxwell Thorpe, landing 14.2% and 14% of the overall vote, respectively.
