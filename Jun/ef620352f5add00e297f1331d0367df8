Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. With clear blue skies and warm weather set to last, we’ve got the itch to ditch our jeans and jackets in favour of something more summery fits.  And while a quick scan of our favourite clothing brands leaves us drooling over gorgeous co-ords, pastel skirts, and yet more floral dresses, we’re keen to curate a closet that’ll see us through the whole season – rather than just a few pub garden trips. So we’re forcing ourselves to forgo purchasing yet another floral midi dress, in favour of more foundational pieces that’ll help shape our summer wardrobes for years to come.  Focusing on basic buys that can be styled both up and down, we’ve pulled together a collection of summer staples you’ll get maximum use from, and feel great in.
