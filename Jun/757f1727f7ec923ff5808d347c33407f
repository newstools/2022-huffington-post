Liz Truss has been savaged on Twitter after calling Ireland’s prime minister to “tea sock”. The foreign secretary delivered the bizarre pronunciation of “Taoiseach” as the government unveiled its plans to unilaterally over-ride the Northern Ireland protocol. Irish premier Michael Martin said: “It represents a new low point because the natural expectation of democratic countries like ourselves, the UK and all across Europe is that we honour international agreements that we enter into.” Recording a clip for broadcast media, Truss stumbled after appearing to realise her blunder. She said: “I would strongly encourage the Irish tea sock ... to discuss this with the EU.” Liz Truss stumbles over Taoiseach & ends up calling the Irish PM a tea sock. pic.twitter.com/Ij50SrN18f Unsurprisingly, her verbal slip quickly became a social media sensation, with Twitter users merciless in their condemnation.

European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said: “Renegotiation of the protocol is unrealistic. No workable alternative solution has been found to this delicate, long-negotiated balance. “Any renegotiations would simply bring further legal uncertainty for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland. For these reasons the European Union will not renegotiate the protocol.”
