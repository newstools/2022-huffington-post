Harry’s choice of bedtime story ties in with the release of his third album, Harry’s House, which comes out on Friday. Announcing his CBeebies appearance, the former One Direction star said: “Tonight’s bedtime story is about a house full of love and laughter.”  The chart-topping musician follows in the footsteps of celebrities like Tom Hardy, Regé-Jean Page, Dolly Parton and Kate Middleton by appearing in the CBeebies story corner. Earlier this month, Strictly Come Dancing champion Rose Ayling-Ellis became the first star to tell a bedtime story on the show using British Sign Language, to mark the end of Deaf Awareness Week. Last week, Harry celebrated his sixth consecutive week at number one with the lead single from Harry’s House, As It Was. He’s also gearing up for the release of two new films, the thriller Don’t Worry Darling and the historical romance My Policeman. Harry Styles’ CBeebies Bedtime Story will air on Monday 23 May at 6.50pm BBC One. It will also be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.
