If anyone knows how to steal the show, it’s Blake Lively.  Lively, who’s co-chair of this year’s Met Gala alongside her husband Ryan Reynolds, ignited the red carpet with her arrival on Monday evening.

Her bow-embellished dress metamorphosed into an aqua blue showstopper as her assistants helped ‘unwrap’ it on the red carpet.

Resembling iconic New York City landmarks like the Empire State Building, the dress was accessorised with a crown featuring seven spikes in a nod to the Statue of Liberty. The Gossip Girl star said this year’s event was “especially nerve-wracking.” “Being one of the hosts, you really feel like you need to bring your A-game,” she said.  She’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment #MetGala #blakelively pic.twitter.com/w4XDtESVFA This year’s Met Gala theme was In America: An Anthology of Fashion, but Blake put her own twist on it by representing New York and focusing on the “architecture rather than just the fashion.”  The actor has dominated the Met Gala red carpet over the years, and she has yet to disappoint.  She is matching the carpet in every picture.

The entire ensemble took 600 hours to make by hand.
