With so many people across the UK heading to the ballot boxes on May 5 for the local elections, it’s only natural they would bring their four-legged companions along. In fact, in the last few years it has become an informal social media tradition for people to share photos of their pooches at the polling station. And this year is no exception – even prime minister Boris Johnson and London mayor Sadiq Khan brought their dogs along to vote. Council seats in Scotland, Wales, London and parts of England are available while Northern Ireland is electing its new assembly, with polls open until 10pm. But today’s local elections, where the Conservatives are expected to experience significant losses, saw some extra additions joining the #DogsAtPollingStations trend... Here’s a roundup of the most unusual photos making the rounds to light up your day. Today's the day to go out there and show the Government what you think of them. #dogsatpollingstations pic.twitter.com/8VqeDVMDjo Maybe by the general election we'll have escalated to photos of people looking like twats trying to take photos of their dogs at polling stations.
