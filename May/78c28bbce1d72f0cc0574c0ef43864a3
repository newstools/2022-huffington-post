If you tuned into Monday night’s instalment of EastEnders, you might have spotted a topical reference to the recent Eurovision result. The most recent episode of the BBC opened with Callum and Frankie (played by Tony Clay and Rose Ayling-Ellis) having a conversation about his relationship in the kitchen. To a clearly upset Callum, Frankie was heard joking: “This is about the Eurovision isn’t it? But Ukraine deserved that win and there’s always next year.” He responded: “I never used to watch it, and then Ben got me into it and… nul points every year, the one year we don’t watch it together we get second.” Hands up if someone said this to you today! @BBCEurovision #EastEnders pic.twitter.com/p3AGe6jau6 While EastEnders is usually filmed months in advance, the scene referencing the Eurovision result was filmed at the eleventh hour to reference the UK’s success in Turin over the weekend. In the past, EastEnders has included similar topical references to events like the Brexit referendum result, goings on in the Royal Family and England’s performance in the Euro 2020 tournament last year. Saturday night saw Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra triumphing on the Eurovision stage, while the UK representative Sam Ryder gave us our best result in over 20 years when he finished in second place. His song Space Man – which received the most points from the Eurovision juries this year – is also on course to become the first UK Eurovision song to land within the top 10 since Scooch’s Flying The Flag (For You) in 2007. It’s since been revealed that it could even be a contender for the number one spot, which would make Space Man the first Eurovision track to do so since Gina G’s Ooh Aah… Just A Little Bit.
