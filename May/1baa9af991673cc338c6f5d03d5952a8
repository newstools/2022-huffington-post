It’s high in the Netflix charts and working its way into our hearts. And if you’re not watching, you might be in the minority right now. Yep, Heartstopper is the latest coming-of-age TV drama to have grabbed our collective attention, with a cast of (mostly) newcomers charting the ups and downs of queer teenage love, and great support from the likes of Olivia Colman and Stephen Fry. Oh, and a stonking soundtrack that has all in the feels. Charlie and Nick’s story – when skinny queer boy meets straight rugby lad at school, could friendship turn to something more? – has viewers reflecting on the heartstopping moments in their own lives. From the ones you had as teens to the ones you wish you’d had, and those you’re still dreaming of in the future, we can’t get enough of these tweets. This was my HeartStopper, more than 25 years ago, and I still remember his kisses @nicolasbecerrap 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘 ; separated now, but unstoppable once; not one regret, only good memories at least for me pic.twitter.com/GRRRz6S64e Gah! Just completed Heartstopper. The tissues bought for a cold have been reassigned. Lots of emotions throughout but especially the incredibly tender coming out scenes with his mom which mirrored my own and brought those moments flooding back to me. Just watched #Heartstopper for the second time and it brings back so many memories of my childhood! Be proud of who you are! ❤️ This was my Heartstopper. She still is. pic.twitter.com/Eh3LH67vgn SO THE SAME CLASSMATE WHO I SAID WAS REALLY PRETTY YESTERDAY DREW A SMILEY FACE ON MY HAND W THEIR EYELINER IN SCIENCE YALL IM HAVING MY HEARTSTOPPER MAIN CHARACTER MOMENT!!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/HOAusk2TxG Some guy I met last night did this to me  out of nowhere wtf I’ve had my heartstopper moment lmao pic.twitter.com/iErmmOzWj2 The best thing just happened to me, i don’t think we talk about the impact of heartstopper on the older generations, my mum (aged 49) is currently watching it and decided to come out as bi to me, im Im fully sobbing she is the most amazing person and I’m so proud of her☹️🥰 thinking about how heartstopper gave me the confidence to try to get my own hi! hi! moment with the boy i like and now i keep running into him and seeing him everywhere and it really is like the hi! hi! montage and how did neither of them combust i get so flustered every time 🫠 young royals and heartstopper taught me how to accept myself and to know that i don't nessesarely have to decide about my sexuality. these series and the actors showed me that no matter who i love, i am the same person as i was and that i should be myself all the time <3 the way i wish i had my own heartstopper moments but i’m too scared to fall in love with a girl cus what if my family cuts me off 🥰 i’m a coward this sucks atp it’s either i come out and lose my family or i don’t and still have them and tbh idw to lose them :) about to finish another school year without my own heartstopper moment yesss 😔 watching every minute of heartstopper is so bittersweet like when is my quirky sweet little queer moment gonna happen im pic.twitter.com/wd5dNl3Cwb This was my Heartstopper. pic.twitter.com/UGqMAaR1f7 this was my heartstopper pic.twitter.com/9Pb4IFXPBn this was my heartstopper pic.twitter.com/PSFvPNwSpR this was my heartstopper pic.twitter.com/LSOuEiXOx0 This was my heartstopper (?) pic.twitter.com/R3S78MD60m I didn’t have a Heartstopper moment growing up, so I made my own.. https://t.co/aUMAaXRi4H Am i gonna get my own “Heartstopper” moment? pic.twitter.com/s6FJ9v6yqr all i want in life is to have my own heartstopper moment with someone. manifesting my own heartstopper moment <3 pic.twitter.com/1Oqdc3uq56
