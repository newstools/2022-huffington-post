Kevin Spacey has been charged with four counts of sexual assault against three different men, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced. The alleged incidents took place in London between March 2005 and August 2008, and in Gloucestershire in April 2013. Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said on Thursday afternoon: “The CPS has authorised criminal charges against Kevin Spacey, 62, for four counts of sexual assault against three men. “He has also been charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The charges follow a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation. “The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Mr Spacey are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.” The Metropolitan Police said that Spacey’s accusers are in their 30s and 40s. Meanwhile, the CPS said it could not confirm or deny whether or not Spacey will need to be extradited to the UK.  Spacey is a two-time Oscar winner and known for starring roles in American Beauty, The Usual Suspects and the Netflix drama House Of Cards. He was previously artistic director of The Old Vic theatre in London.
