Rylan Clark is finally set to return to Celebrity Gogglebox – and in even better news, he’s bringing his mum with him too.  The pair proved a huge hit with viewers when they appeared on the first two series of the spin-off from the Channel 4 show.  However, they were absent from the third series in 2021 when Rylan took a break from the spotlight following the breakdown of his marriage to husband Dan Neal.  Rylan and mum Linda are now confirmed to take their place on the sofa once again for a newly-announced Pride special of Celebrity Gogglebox later this year.  Doors are closed. See you next series! @Rylan #BasicInstinct #CelebrityGogglebox pic.twitter.com/mnX4U29WN6 Airing as part of Channel 4′s Pride At 50 series, Rylan and Linda will be joined by other LGBTQ+ stars including Nick Grimshaw and niece Liv, and The Chase’s Paul Sinha and his husband Oliver.
