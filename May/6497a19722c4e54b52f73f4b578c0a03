For the third year in a row, Olivia remains the number one name for girls in the US after overtaking Emma in 2019. Meanwhile, Liam holds steady as the most popular name for boys for the fifth straight year.  The SSA compiles the annual list based on the names parents in the US gave their babies born in the previous year.

The only other change on the boys top 10 list is that Theodore made the ranking for the first time, coming in at number 10 and bumping Alexander down to number 13.
