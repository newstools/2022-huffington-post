Feels like only last week my kids were ‘bored’ battling their way through the Easter holidays. If, like me, you’ve been in denial, half term’s probably crept up on you rather suddenly. I know that feeling of dread ahead of any school holiday. The questions of: what am I going to do with them? How can I keep them busy? What can I do to limit their screen time? And that doesn’t even take the weather into account.  I’ve tried everything to keep my high-maintenance, boisterous kids who never sit still entertained and there are a few life-savers that work for us. Below are some of the things that will either buy you some ‘me’ time or give you back some much-needed sanity. All while keeping the kids occupied. Remember. You got this.
