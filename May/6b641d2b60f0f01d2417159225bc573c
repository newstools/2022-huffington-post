Chances are that either way, you no longer have a dedicated space at work. Instead you’re having to hot desk. Pre-pandemic, you probably had a desk or, dare we say it, even office of your own, complete with in-tray, pictures, a plant or two, and the regulation pile of shoes below the desk. Those were the days, weren’t they?  But if hot-desking has now become the norm in your workplace, you might be struggling with having to clear your belongings at the end of every day. But while you might not be able to personalise your space, that doesn’t mean you can’t improve your setup. Packing your work bag is a good place to start. With that in mind, we’ve rounded up some (easily portable) buys that are guaranteed to make hot desking a far more enjoyable experience.
