Sharon Osbourne has shared her frustration at contracting Covid after rushing back to the US to care for husband Ozzy after he tested positive for the virus.  The former X Factor judge was forced to take a break from hosting her new TalkTV show just three days after its launch so she could fly home to be with Ozzy.  However, she later told co-star Jeremy Kyle via video call that her “entire household” had subsequently tested positive.  Despite feeling “fine” earlier this week, Sharon has now shared a picture of herself on social media in bed with a drip connected to her arm. She captioned her post with some angry swearing emojis. Sharon previously tested positive for the virus in December 2020 and spent a brief period in hospital.  Last week, the star – who is one of the faces of the new TalkTV channel launched by News UK earlier this month – vowed to return to her show The Talk as soon as possible. Of missing her show, Sharon added: “I can’t believe my luck. I’m missing the show and I’ve only been there three days. Three days and I’m missing the show but I will be back. I know I will. “It will take me a week to get my old man back on his feet again and I will be back.” Earlier this week, Sharon said the Black Sabbath star was now “on the mend”.  The Talk airs weeknights at 9pm on TalkTV and YouTube.
