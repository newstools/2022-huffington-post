Boris Johnson has told the DUP to “roll up their sleeves” and enter government at Stormont with Sinn Fein. The prime minister also defended government plans to introduce a new law allowing them to unilaterally rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol. Johnson spoke out after talks with the leadership of all five parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The DUP has refused to agree a power-sharing deal with Sinn Fein - who are now the largest party at Stormont - unless the Protocol governing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland is redrawn. They are angry that it has led to a customs border in the Irish Sea and last week refused to nominate a speaker, meaning the Assembly is unable to function. Asked if he had made efforts persuade the DUP to join a power-sharing executive, the PM said: “I think everybody should be rolling up their sleeves and get stuck in to the government of Northern Ireland. “The province has got so much going for it but you need leadership and you need government. “So you bet I said to the DUP in particular ‘we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a speaker in the assembly’, of course. “The issue they have is that they object to the operation of the protocol. We don’t want to scrap it, but we think it can be fixed.”
