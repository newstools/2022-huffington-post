Fans of the hit Channel 4 drama It’s A Sin have been voicing their disappointment following this year’s TV Baftas, after the show went home empty-handed despite being the night’s top nominee. It’s A Sin debuted in January 2021, telling the story of a group of friends living through the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s and early 90s. The show was met with a wave of acclaim, which eventually included an impressive seven nominations at the TV Baftas, more than any other show. Cast members Olly Alexander, Lydia West, Omari Douglas, Callum Scott Howells and David Carlyle all received recognition for their performances in It’s A Sin, while the show itself was also in the running for Best Mini-Series. A scene in which Colin discovered he had AIDS was also nominated in the Must-See TV Moment category. However, during Sunday night’s ceremony, It’s A Sin didn’t pick up any of the awards it was nominated for, which has not gone down well with its loyal fans: Don't know why people are so surprised It's A Sin didn't win a single BAFTA. In the 1980s people didn't care about gay men dying of AIDS. In the 2020s? Every one of those BAFTA juries didn't care either. LGBT stories — our lives — never quite matter. We keep being reminded of it. No disrespect to the BAFTA winners tonight but how did It's A Sin not receive a single award? That series was 🔥🙌🏿🔥 phenomenal. How did It’s A Sin not win a single Bafta? Just perplexing. One of the greatest moments of television in the history of television. @BAFTA really needs to take a look what went wrong. One of the most necessary, powerful, life-affirming dramas in recent years, shining a light on LGBTQ+ history and receiving viewer and critical acclaim.And yet no awards tonight. I’m still angry about all of this and will be for a long time.An upside was that *many* people at the ceremony thought the same thing: it was the talking point of the whole evening. something strange happened tonight - it seemed bafta thought it's a sin important enough to be nominated for the most awards of any show tonight (7) but somehow not good enough to win a single one? there's a conversation to be had about how performative this validation was. After last nights #BAFTAs I have to say — #ItsASin is the one show which stays with me. The impact it had on so many people and the way it evoked so much emotion for people to want to learn more about their communities history and raise further awareness, a winner, trophy or not. Yup...for all the love it got (rightly obviously).This is why I STILL bang on about plays that deal with AIDS, this is why I talk about culture and 'know your history'Because AIDS, because gay men (despite lovely teen dramas) is still too much it seems. https://t.co/PUeOZxOOud Wait a sec, so It’s A Sin, the most important drama of the past year, if not the last decade, has won nothing?! #Baftas2022 #BAFTATV #itsasin Not a single award for “It’s a Sin” at a very puzzling BAFTA TV Awards. #Baftas2022 pic.twitter.com/yILhhc7FTJ Congrats to all the BAFTA winners. Gutted for It’s A Sin, thought it was going to clean up, but nothing. Such is the way of voted awards, though, sometimes this happens. What a shame. There hasn’t been a *day* since that I haven’t thought about that show. Life changing. I have never ever felt the way about a drama the way I did watching It’s A Sin. I don’t really cry at anything. I broke down in tears. In front of my parents. Something I typically find mortifying. I didn’t stop thinking about that last episode for months. Deserved more. #BAFTAs It’s A Sin being up for 11 BAFTAS and only winning for editing and direction… hmm pic.twitter.com/TTkf1JAmM8 It’s A Sin:• Most binge-watched show on All4 📺• Channel 4's biggest drama launch 🎭 • Raised £100,000 for Terrence Higgins Trust w/ t-shirts 💸• Created an upsurge in HIV testing 🩸• Celebrated gay sex on mainstream TV 💦Isn’t that truly winning? 💅 #BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/q25yiQ0Nf4 It’s A Sin and all involved should win special BAFTAs all of their own. It remains the most joyful, heartbreaking and validating drama I’ve ever experienced. #la #BAFTAs pic.twitter.com/BlehJ45reh It's A Sin will be remembered long after most BAFTA winners, and that's more important than any trophy. Many viewers were also confused by the fact that clips of It’s A Sin used during the ceremony appeared to be muted: Watching the Bafta's thinking there was something wrong with the sound during the It's A Sin clips; it turns out they were censoring it. Then they didn't win a single award - for what was the best show all year. Something smells. Regressed to the 1950s? #ItsASin #Baftas2022 It wasn’t just my tv, was it? Were all the mentions of HIV/AIDS in clips of It’s A Sin muted out of the BAFTA broadcast? So it didn’t win anything tonight AND it was censored for no good reason? Why is every it’s a sin clip muted? It’s hardly bad Language in every scene  #BAFTAs Something doesn’t sit quite right with me - It’s a Sin’s clips being muted (yet clips showing shootings were aired) AND the fact the series got completely overlooked. Let’s be honest, it was BY FAR the most incredible and gripping series in a very long time #Baftas2022 #ItsASin still waiting for an explanation as to why it's a sin was muted when they showed a shooting and clips of people swearing absolutely raging at the clips of It’s A Sin being muted and also them not winning a single award! That was one of the best shows of the last few years. Fuming. #BAFTAs #ItsASin Cannot believe BAFTA not only gave It’s A Sin 0 awards tonight, but they also MUTED the clips THEY chose for the nomination reels? Really? It’s A Sin was robbed and completely disgraceful that all the clips which spoke about HIV/AIDS were muted…seriously this is 2022 wtf?! #BAFTAs The acting prizes the It’s A Sin cast lost out on went to Matthew MacFadyen for Succession, Jodie Comer for Help and Sean Bean for Time, which was also the recipient of the Best Mini-Series award. Meanwhile, Rose Ayling-Ellis and Giovanni Pernice’s “silent” routine from this year’s Strictly Come Dancing was named Must-See TV Moment, the only award voted for by members of the public. It’s worth noting that It’s A Sin did win in the Best Director: Fiction category at the Bafta TV Craft Awards, which took place last month. The show was also named Best New Drama at last year’s National Television Awards, as chosen by the public.
