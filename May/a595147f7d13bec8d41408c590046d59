If you’ve been thinking about getting some wireless earbuds (and preferably buds you can afford) then you might be wondering where to start.  With the sheer number of earbuds to choose from you’d be forgiven for feeling confused, intimidated or both. And if you’re looking for more affordable earbuds than Apple AirPods then it can be difficult working out which buds are best for you.
