Timothée Chalamet’s West End debut has been cancelled after facing two years of delays – and it’s fair to say fans are devastated.  The Call Me By Your Name actor was due to tread the boards in an adaptation of the critically acclaimed play 4,000 Miles at The Old Vic.  The production, which was also set to star Dame Eileen Atkins, was originally scheduled to open in London in April 2020 but was postponed when theatres across the country had to close their doors due to the pandemic.  However, The Old Vic has now confirmed the show will not be going ahead after it proved “impossible” to reschedule.  A statement said: “Following the postponement of 4000 Miles due to the pandemic, and despite an enormous amount of effort from all involved, we have now sadly and reluctantly concluded that we are unable to reschedule the production at a time possible for everyone involved. “After two years of trying hard to make it work, it has proved impossible. “We’re sorry not to have better news, and we want to thank our audiences for their continued patience and understanding.” Timothée was due to star as 21-year-old Leo, who, after suffering a major loss during a summer bike riding trip, seeks solace in the New York home of his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera.  Thursday’s announcement was met with disappointment from Timothée’s fans on social media... The dream is over, gang. 4000 Miles featuring Dame Eileen and Timothee Chalamet will not be coming to London. pic.twitter.com/CtJziCS5Bk bye bye to “4000 miles”…I’m so sad to not seeing timothée on stage 😭 pic.twitter.com/H0xPcCQBai After waiting nearly 3 years, I just had an email to say I’m being refunded for my 4000 Miles tickets. It was a play at the Old Vic Theatre that would have had Timothee Chalamet staring in it. I was so lucky to get tickets so to say I’m absolutely gutted is an understatement 🫥😭 Heartbroken about 4000 miles @oldvictheatre w/ Timothée Chalamet & Eileen Atkins. Booked my flight, cleared my schedule, took my AL. Then COVID hit. Strong hold the tickets for more than 2 yrs hoping for miracles Damn! Imagine what could have been, seeing his performance in flesh pic.twitter.com/VDtkFRaIE0 After two years of waiting, The Old Vic have had to cancel 4,000 Miles 😫I’ll never see Timothee Chalamet up close 😫 The actor is one of Hollywood’s most sought-after young actors having recently starred in 2021’s Dune and 2019’s Little Women. He will next be seen on screen in coming-of-age romance horror Bones & All later this year, and recently filmed his role as Willy Wonka in the Charlie & The Chocolate Factory prequel Wonka, which is due for release next year.
