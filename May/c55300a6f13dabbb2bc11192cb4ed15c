But we reckon most modern father figures don’t really fit this mould, and would actually like to unwrap something a little less stereotypical – and a little more thoughtful – come June 19. Whether he’s not much of a drinker, is more into tech than tools, or likes to stay well-groomed, your dad deserves something special.  So, put down that pair of navy socks – and look through this list to find something he actually wants this Father’s Day.
