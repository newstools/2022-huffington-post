If, like pretty much the rest of the globe, you’ve completely fallen for the charms of Heartstopper, then we bring you the news you’ve all been waiting for. Netflix has confirmed that the LGBTQ+ teen drama will be returning for not one, but two brand new series. The show, which is based on author and illustrator Alice Oseman’s graphic novels, has retrained a 100% Critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes since the series debuted on the streaming service last month. The drama has also been a huge global success, reaching the Netflix Top Ten list in 54 countries. It has not only become one of the streaming service’s most popular shows, but it’s made overnight stars out of its mostly unknown cast, including the two leads, Kit Connor and Joe Locke, the latter of which had never acted before. Joe, who plays Charlie Spring, has already revealed what he wants to see in the second season. “I’m excited for [Charlie and Nick],” Joe told British GQ. If we get another season (fingers crossed), I’m looking forward to seeing how they develop as a couple.” He continued: “In the next graphic novel, Charlie struggles with his mental health and I’d love to explore that more. “I think a lot of mental health and eating disorder shows tackle mental health in a way that is hard-hitting and really dark, but I’d love to come at these issues from a lighter place.” Meanwhile, in another interview with Variety, Joe also shared his casting hopes for the next instalment of Heartstopper. “Jennifer Coolidge should play my grandmother,” he said. “That would be so cool. I love her. She’s amazing. “I also want a scene with Nick’s mum so I can work with Olivia Colman.”
