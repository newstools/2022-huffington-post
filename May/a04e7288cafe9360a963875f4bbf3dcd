Never mind the Tory defeats in the local elections, the big news on Friday morning was Huw Edwards and his breakfast croissant. The BBC News host was up at the crack to present the early morning bulletin that was dominated by Labour and Lib Dems making gains in the local elections. But things got derailed temporarily, by Huw’s pastry. Wiping his lips, Huw told viewers: “I’m going to admit to you that I’ve just had a little bit of croissant and I’m just finishing it, I’m ashamed to say that but there you go… it’s um, twenty to six in the morning.” #AccidentalPartridge pic.twitter.com/Get6UQSYo7 Minutes later, things went decidedly Alan Partridge when Huw got political scientist Sir John Curtice, who was in a different part of the studio crunching the numbers from yesterday’s local elections, involved. “I’m just wondering if Sir John Curtice has been helping himself to French patisserie this morning as he’s chomping through his data,” Huw said. “I was just about to say Huw, whether you were going to send them up to us, they’ve certainly not reached here yet,” John replied. UPDATE: Sir John Curtice has NOT yet eaten a croissant but has been reassured that he will receive one. pic.twitter.com/ra671I24e7 Twitter was here for all of the flaky Friday chit chat... This is the public service broadcasting we need Croissant shame 😂  pic.twitter.com/5GmClNHk18 Saving his petrol station scotch egg for later I love watching that man on TV. He could eat a three course meal during the news and I would forgive him and watch.
