Which means that now is the time to stock up on suncream to keep yourself and your little ones safe.  In the warmer weather, it’s natural to want to spend as much time outside as possible, but if you fail to apply a high quality SPF, you could be putting your skin health at risk.  SPF is non-negotiable in hot weather, but what happens if you find that your skin reacts badly to sun protection? If you’ve got sensitive or allergy prone skin, some SPFs may cause redness and irritation. However, if you opt for a hypoallergenic formula, these issues should disappear.  Whether you prefer to spritz, pour or spray your sunscreen on, we’ve got you covered with our roundup of some of the best hypoallergenic suncreams that are suitable for even the more sensitive of skin.
