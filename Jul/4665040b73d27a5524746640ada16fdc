BBC Breakfast host Jon Kay was confronted with one of the unfortunate realities about live broadcasting outdoors during Monday’s show. Just a week into his tenure as the show’s main presenter, following the departure of Dan Walker, Jon presented the latest instalment of the daytime show outdoors in Cambridge, amid the heatwave currently sweeping the UK. Unfortunately, while there, he was reminded of some of the harsh truths of nature. And he may well have been left regretting his decision to wear such a light-coloured suit. “Carol, have you got any tips for removing bird poo from linen jackets?” he asked colleague Carol Kirkwood while speaking to her via video-link, revealing he’d just been “splatted by a pigeon”.

In the meantime, I’m just glad it wasn’t a swan, to be honest, it was just a pigeon.” From the studio, Jon’s co-host Nina Warhurst assured him that while it might not feel like it, “that delivery is considered good luck!” BBC Breakfast airs every weekday from 6am on BBC One.
