If you’re stuck at home (or in a sweltering workplace), the heat can quickly start to irritate you or even become dangerous.  Being caught in your own personal sauna can make you feel drowsy, irritated and seriously restless. So getting the basics right – like staying hydrated, keeping to the shade where possible, and closing your curtains during the day – is essential.  But to help make this heatwave – and the rest of summer – a little more manageable for you, your kids and your pets, we’ve rounded up some wonderfully cooling buys to beat the heat and actually stay cool.
