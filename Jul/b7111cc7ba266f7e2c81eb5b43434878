It’s been an exciting 12 months for British singer-songwriter Cat Burns. A year ago, you’d be forgiven for not having heard of her, but in the last few months she’s had huge success with her single Go (held off the top of the charts only by Harry Styles’ mammoth As It Was), collaborated with Sam Smith and performed everywhere from the Royal Albert Hall to James Corden’s US talk show. Here, we speak to Cat about the first queer character she remembers connecting to, her personal coming out anthem and the LGBTQ+ artists who are “changing the way we view everything”... I didn’t have a queer person I can remember looking up to when I was young, I only had my realisation when I was 19. It wasn’t necessarily an LGBTQ show, but Pretty Little Liars. The character Emily was a lesbian, which at my young age I didn’t realise I resonated with, but I had a real connection to that character. My song Free! And Dodie’s She. I absolutely loved Moonlight. It was a coming of age story that had sexuality as a part of it. I also loved Atypical. Marsha P Johnson. Lil Nas X, Maddie Zahm, Kehlani and so many people who are changing the way we view everything. Because we are so far from where we need to be, Pride is still a protest march and there’s still so much we need to fight for. Come out only when you’re ready and it’s safe to. There’s a community waiting to hold you with open arms. Watch the music video for Cat Burns’ Go below:
