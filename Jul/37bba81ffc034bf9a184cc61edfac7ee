Consider this your official warning to get out the pumice stone, and dust off the trusty white nail polish; it’s open-toe time! We’re far too hot for trainer socks, so we’re officially swapping spring trainers for summer sandals for the foreseeable. When it comes to purchasing a pair of sandals, there’s a lot to consider. Are you looking for an affordable and on trend pair to see you through the season, or would you prefer to invest in some staple sandals that’ll be with you for many summers to come? Do sliders and slip-on styles work well for you, or (like me) have you got narrow feet that always require adjustable straps?  To help you narrow down your choices, here’s a broad selection of different sandals proving popular this summer.  We’ve purposefully gone for a range of different styles and price points, so you can be sure to find the perfect pair for you!
