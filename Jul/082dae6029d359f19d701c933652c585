Children have a rather original approach to the English language, and parents have taken note.  In fact, many of them use Twitter to share their kids’ funny malapropisms and creative turns of phrase. Below, we’ve rounded up 30 tweets from parents about what their kids call things. (And we must admit, some of their choices are arguably superior to the dictionary-official terms).  5: Daddy, I’ve seen lots of books about diarrhoea. Diarrhoea of a spider. Diarrhoea of a wimpy kid. Diarrhoea of a pug.Me: I think you mean diary. 7 described the tree in her school as "perpendular" so that's what we're calling it from now on. My 6yo thinks that Good Friday is called Freaky Friday and I'm not correcting her. My kid recently discovered double stuffed Oreos and now he refers to regular ones as “Diet Oreos”. I’m never correcting my 5YO who calls getting her nails clipped as getting a ‘panicure’ Instead of "yeet," my 6-year-old yells "YEAST," and I will never, ever correct her. My daughter says “cheese” instead of “geez” and I swear I’m never correcting her because it’s the absolute cutest thing.“I just want to wear my pjs all day, cheese mom.” Daughter calls flies “fake bees” My 1 yo calls dandelions “blow” which is cute until I’m prying open her mouth pleading with her to not eat the blow. my 4yo calls it "root bear" and created this easy recipe, so try it out!1. take fizzy water2. put a root in it3. push a bear's face in it My 2-year-old calls Sesame Street “PEH-FAH-MEE FWEET” and I can’t handle it 😫 Will try to get it on video. My 3 year old calls Flonase "mommy's special nose medicine" and now my neighbor thinks I do cocaine. 2yo pronounces the number 15 as ”five-teen” and I have no intention of correcting her. My daughter calls her forehead her "hairbone" and we love it so much. My son refers to the end pieces on a loaf of bread as "the bandaid pieces".As in, "gross, don't use the bandaid pieces to make your sandwich!" toddler pronounces forklifts as f***lips so that’s fun in public My four-year-old calls question marks “mystery marks.”
