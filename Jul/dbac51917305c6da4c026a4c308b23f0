Bottomless brunch, happy hour, and full-bottle wine nights are great, until you wake up the next morning feeling like your head is gonna explode.  Gone are the dreamy days when you could drink as many margaritas as you wanted and feel fresh as a daisy the next day. In their place, sits the hangover from hell – sometimes even stretching into a two-day hangover extravaganza.

We’ve rounded up some simple self-care methods that should help you to shift that hangover a little faster.
