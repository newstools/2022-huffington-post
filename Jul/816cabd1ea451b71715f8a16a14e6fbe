The chart-topping singer had been due to perform at Copenhagen’s Royal Arena on Sunday night as part of his Love On Tour world jaunt. However, earlier that day, a fatal shooting took place at the Field’s shopping centre less than a mile from the arena, which is situated on the southern outskirts of the city. Following this, the decision was taken to cancel the former One Direction singer’s show. Promoters Live Nation said the concert was “cancelled by direction of the Danish Police”. “We are all truly devastated by the events of today and our thoughts are with the victims and their families,” they said in a statement. “We are looking into future possibilities for the show, and hope to be able to give ticket buyers direct information as soon as possible.” In a tweet, Harry subsequently told fans: “I’m heartbroken along with the people of Copenhagen. I adore this city. The people are so warm and full of love.” I’m heartbroken along with the people of Copenhagen. I adore this city. The people are so warm and full of love. I’m devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting. I’m sorry we couldn’t be together. Please look after each other.
