We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors. Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI — prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Amazon Prime Day 2022 is well into day two and you’d think the deals would be drying up– but they really aren’t! In fact, there are still loads of dazzling discounts to be had, especially across homeware and beauty and plenty of them well under £30. We’ve rounded up the best we can find here, but grab them while you can, as they’ll only last as long as stocks do (and Prime Day finishes for good at midnight tonight). FYI — deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post as up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the event to see our latest updates as the deals change! To take advantage of these Prime Day deals, you’ll need an Amazon Prime membership.
