Boris Johnson has been given a standing ovation by Tory MPs - just weeks after they mounted a coup to boot him out of office. The tribute came at the end of Johnson’s final prime minister’s questions. It was held two weeks after dozens of ministers quit en masse in a bid to force the PM from office. And last month, 148 Tory MPs voted against Johnson in a vote of confidence in his leadership. Conservative backbenchers had been split on whether to applaud him after his final Commons clash with Labour leader Keir Starmer.

However, opposition MPs remained in their seats. Labour leader Keir Starmer had earlier paid his own tribute to the outgoing prime minister. He said: “I would like to take this opportunity to wish him, his wife and his family the best for the future.” Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told the PM: “I would like to wish him and his family all the best for the future. “Can I say we have been through many dark times within this House and none more so than through the pandemic, and always will be remembered for what this House did and the way you’ve conducted those duties during those dark times.” Johnson and Starmer quickly resumed their normal hostilities, with the Labour leader saying he will “miss the delusion” when the PM finally leaves office on September 6. And at the end of the 45-minute session, the prime minister quoted The Terminator’s famous catchphrase as he said: “Hasta la vista, baby.”
