Do you like this? Do you like what I’m doing?’” Talking about the moment he turned to his co-star, he continued: “I was talking to Joe and at one point I was so deep into it, he was like ’Dude I can’t save you, but I promise you it’s gonna be fine.” Joesph – whose character had a pivotal role in season four’s finale – recently revealed he was shocked as everyone else by one of the show’s most “f**king horrible” scenes, believing it would be cut out by Netflix bosses.
