Amazon Prime Day 2022 is a go, and we’ve already rounded up some of the best deals across fitness, beauty, cleaning, parenting, pets and household essentials for you. But sometimes we spot a saving and we just know we need to shout about it – and the current discount on Apple AirPods Pro is one of those. For Prime Day members, there’s a huge £60 off these top-rated headphones – that’s a sizeable 25% saving, and big news for an Apple product. This means you can buy the AirPods and MagSafe charging case for just £179, rather than the usual retail price of £239. But this amazing deal only lasts as long as stocks do, so move quickly if you want yours. To take advantage of Prime Day deals, you’ll need an Amazon Prime membership.
