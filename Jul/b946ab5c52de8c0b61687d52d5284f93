If Squid Game taught us anything, it’s that there can only be one winner. So also goes the rules for the Emmy Awards, which have the challenge of narrowing down television’s best in a particularly exceptional year, when series like Succession, Abbott Elementary, Euphoria, Ted Lasso, The Dropout the aforementioned Netflix dystopian thriller all competed for our attention. With the number of shows in contention rebounding to new highs following pandemic-induced production shutdowns, the Television Academy was tasked with winnowing the cream from an overcrowded 2022 crop when the nominations were unveiled Tuesday morning. In the end, Succession led the way with 25 nominations, while The White Lotus and Ted Lassso were not far behind on 20 each. Stranger Things, Squid Game and Hacks were also among the top-nominated shows, with a host of British talent also up for major awards. Check out the full list of nominations below...
