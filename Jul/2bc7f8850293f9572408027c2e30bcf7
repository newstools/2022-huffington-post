Whether the rooms in your home are a little on the small side or you’re trying to squeeze a couple of kids into one room, maximising the space you do have is key. Storage is non negotiable (as kids always seem to have so much stuff), and that storage needs to be easily (and safely) accessible. You’ll also need to go for products that are designed with little fingers in mind and won’t lead to injuries.  The good news is that even in the smallest spaces, it’s possible to keep the crazy kid clutter at bay. To help you, we’ve rounded up some of the bed space-saving storage solutions for children’s bedrooms, even those on the smaller side.
