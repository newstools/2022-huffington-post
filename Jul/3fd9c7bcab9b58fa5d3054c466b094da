Dominic Raab has denied being a snob after he faced a backlash for calling Angela Rayner a “champagne socialist” for going to the opera. The deputy prime minister said he was just “gently teasing” the Labour deputy leader during their heated exchange at last week’s prime minister’s questions. Raab condemned Rayner for attending the Glyndebourne Festival Opera while the RMT union strike brought the rail network to a halt. But Rayner hit back, accusing Raab of “snobbery” and telling him he needed to “learn a lesson about opening up the arts to everyone, whatever their background”. Dominic Raab won’t approve but I did indeed go the opera last week (it cost me £62).Tom Eisner, a working-class lad from Buxton near where I grew up kindly invited me.
