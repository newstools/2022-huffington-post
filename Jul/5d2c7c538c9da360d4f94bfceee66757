Boris Johnson has been told to hand over a huge number of documents including his diaries to MPs investigating whether he lied to parliament over partygate. The Commons privileges committee is investigating whether the prime minister misled parliament when he said no lockdown breaking parties took place in No.10. If the MPs decide the outgoing PM knew he was not telling the truth, they can recommend he be suspended or expelled from the Commons. The committee, led by veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, has demanded the following documents by August 15. PM diaries for the following days: 15 May 2020 20 May 2020 19 June 2020 13 November 2020 27 November 2020 15 December 2020 17 December 2020 14 January 2021 Event email invites All email/electronic (including WhatsApp) invites for all events included in the attached timeline.

Covid status of No. 10 staff Information on the number of No.10 staff off work with Covid on the dates of each of the events on the timeline.
