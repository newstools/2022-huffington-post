Alison Hammond was caught off guard during Monday’s edition of This Morning when co-host Dermot O’Leary unexpectedly swore live on air. With regular hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby now on their annual summer break, Alison and Dermot are currently fronting the ITV daytime show. Near the beginning of Monday’s show, Alison commented that it was “like a Big Brother reunion” as she and Dermot spoke to former housemate Kate Lawler via video-link. “We couldn’t pass this moment up by not having a quick look at you and Kate in an iconic moment in the Big Brother house,” Dermot revealed, before the infamous scene in which Alison broke the garden table by jumping on it played. “That is when I was on the table, and obviously Kate’s weight broke it,” Alison joked. “Look how young I am. Young and innocent. And what about you, Derm? You looked hot back in the day.” “What do you mean back in the day?” he responded, with Alison later adding: “How do you feel when you see yourself like that? So young. You were so good at that show.” Dermot then questioned: “Just at that show?” “Yeah, that one,” Alison replied, with the pair then descending into laughter. Apparently forgetting where he was and, indeed, what time of day it was, he then commented: “Such a bitch!” Alison then apologised for Dermot’s language, but as he began introducing the next segment, viewers noticed that she was struggling not to laugh: I’m screaming at Alison trying to keep a straight face after Dermot called her a bitch live on air 😭 #ThisMorning pic.twitter.com/UfSJ7TIROT Dermot saying “such a bitch” and Alison trying to not laugh is getting me through the heatwave #thismorning pic.twitter.com/30xai4b4Tz Alison trying not to laugh at Dermot  is killing me 😂 #thismorning The awkwardness after the “b” bomb was dropped 😂 https://t.co/WOjz1mWsi3 Dermot O’Leary swearing on #thismorning 😂😂😂😂😂😂 brilliant.

She apologised but he hasn’t 👀 Dermot disgustingly calling Alison a bitch. Get rid. #thismorning Last month, Alison and Dermot were at the centre of reports in the Daily Mail claiming their differences had left them struggling to “hit it off” behind the scenes, which were quickly dismissed by an ITV spokesperson. The two first met 20 years ago, after her time as a housemate on Big Brother came to an end, while he was presenting the spin-off show Big Brother’s Little Brother. Prior to their appointment as a permanent This Morning duo, the pair had presented a handful of live episodes together as guest hosts. Alison was already a much-loved member of the This Morning family by this point, garnering a loyal following thanks to her irreverent A-list interviews with A-list stars like Harrison Ford, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Beyoncé. Dermot’s past credits include The X Factor and the National Television Awards, as well as his his own long-running BBC Radio 2 slot. This Morning airs weekdays at 10am on ITV.
