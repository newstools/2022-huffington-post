More than 100 fire engines have been sent to blazes across London as a major incident was declared amid the 40C heat. London Fire Brigade said there had been “a huge surge” in fires across the capital, with London mayor Sadiq Khan saying the service is under “immense pressure” during the historic heatwave.  One of the most dramatic fires was in the village of Wennington, east London, with television footage showing black smoke billowing into the air, with buildings and fields on fire. At least one home appeared to be destroyed in the fire, while smoke covered a wide area. The brigade listed 10 major blazes it was fighting across the city on Tuesday, half of them grass fires. It came as a new provisional UK record temperature was recorded as 40.3C at Coningsby, in Lincolnshire, the Met Office said.
