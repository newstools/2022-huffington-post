Apparently, all the criticism Russia is getting for invading Ukraine is causing a lot of hurt feelings at the Kremlin. On Monday, the Russian government released a list of countries it deemed “unfriendly.”  Not surprisingly, the United States and Ukraine made the list, but many Twitter users were surprised that tiny nations like Liechtenstein, Montenegro and San Marino were included. And they had thoughts. It would’ve been easier to publish a list of countries who have been “friendly” to Russia, but what do I know? 🤷🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/Db8ajwgavW My new preferred tourism list👇 https://t.co/6JHxC8JASA A few Twitter users thought the list reminded them of a movie, but not a “Cold War” classic like “Rocky IV” or “Red Dawn.” Specifically “Mean Girls.” This is like a nemesis list only it makes me think of mean girls instead https://t.co/zpHbPuVRHv Others felt Russia was acting more like Kanye West. Liechtenstein and San Marino on this list makes it feel a bit like when Kanye said he had beef with Peppa Pig. https://t.co/LyOT8TV0Qj A few people wondered why San Marino made the list, but they had theories. Dan Marino, briefly thinking Russia declared war on him this morning. https://t.co/ujuKnf95Uk pic.twitter.com/Oq8M60Q0Iw San Marino punching above it’s weight. https://t.co/5ICi9VGlSX Some jokingly took Russia’s side. Typical shit stirring Liechtenstein. https://t.co/qp7u6960Gy Others had questions. Who has the list of countries Russia has been 'unfriendly' to? https://t.co/STR1gbH5VV The Ukraine is on this list and is under attack? Does that mean someone else is next? If they choose the USA the list will go away. https://t.co/TF5Bh9hy1W But some people noted the list could hurt Russia’s relationship with China since it referred to Taiwan as a country, which goes against China’s insistence that Taiwan is its territory. They listed Ukraine...??And if Russia is such good buddies with China, listing Taiwan as a country is also pretty awkward. https://t.co/BgXWZLi05B In which Russia inadvertently recognizes Taiwan as a country. That will annoy China... https://t.co/30TW3iiYJt
