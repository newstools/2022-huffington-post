After an awards season that has seen the Grammys bumped back due to the Covid crisis and the Golden Globes’ usual broadcast axed amid controversy, the A-listers were finally able to rub shoulders at the weekend, as the Oscars red carpet was rolled out at last. The 94th Academy Awards returned to their usual location at the Los Angeles Dolby Theatre on Sunday night, after last year’s was moved because of the pandemic.
