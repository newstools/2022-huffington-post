You’ve heard it all before: wearing facial sunscreen is a must, and yet far too many of us aren’t using one on a daily basis. Applying yet another product to your face can seem like a real bore, but facial SPF is seriously important.  The right formula will block the sun’s harmful UVA and UVB rays, preventing sunburn, sun damage, and reducing the risk of premature ageing.  Sitting out in the sun might feel absolutely amazing, especially after the long winter months, but the sun’s rays can cause cellular damage that can have a big impact on your skin health. From decreasing collagen production and making the signs of ageing more prominent (yikes) to increased skin pigmentation and a higher skin cancer risk, sun damage is no joke.  Add a facial SPF to your daily skincare routine and your skin will thank you for it – we promise. And to make choosing the best facial sun protector a little easier, we’ve rounded up some best buys perfect for every skin type.
