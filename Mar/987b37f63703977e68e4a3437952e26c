A wave of snow, ice and hail – along with a touch of thunder – hit the UK overnight just days after a heatwave. The influx of bad weather has particularly rocked the east of England and Scotland after a gust of Arctic air pushed temperatures down to below freezing overnight.  West Yorkshire was coated a thick layer of snow this morning, while Manchester, Durham, Midlands and East Anglia were all affected too. According to the Guardian, Newcastle City council even issued an emergency protocol to deal with the sudden cold and to provide immediate support anyone sleeping outdoors. Temperatures heading into the weekend are expected to get up to a maximum of 10C in an unsettling contrast to last week’s sunshine and 20C weather. In some areas, people reported “thundersnow”, a phenomenon where it storms in cold conditions “give rise to heavy downpours of snow”, according to the Met Office. The snowflakes can also reflect the lightning, making it look much brighter. Here’s just a handful of clips being shared on social media showing last night’s the peculiar weather: #uksnow  thunder snow in Redcar pic.twitter.com/Og5yV6FNiC Heavy #snow currently in Dawley, Telford. #uksnow ☃️ pic.twitter.com/WDT0DMHdKL Yorkshire has woken up to snow with a Met Office weather warning in force across a large part of the region.#snow pic.twitter.com/ieJsHe2oY5 ICYMI: Snow covers parts of UK after heatwave pic.twitter.com/PeEK2qJqH7 We have snow in the Uk ❄️🙌🏻 pic.twitter.com/Yi5k1XFh0E There have been reports of #thundersnow overnight.

Practically had a heatwave last week, but this week it snows! Only in the UK! 🤣 A poem in three parts by Joseph Martin pic.twitter.com/i76LgZeHCe Pull that shit in February. The weather's already shit and at least it looks pretty. But don't give us a week of spring and then dump this crap on us, it's not right. Only in the UK we’d go from summer type weather to snow all within a week Where it's not snowing this morning it's mostly clear with some sunny spells.  Cold for all 🥶Quite the contrast... 😬 pic.twitter.com/9znPHlplWU It wasn’t long until people rolled out a jokey new take on how seasons actually work in the UK – with some pointing out that we are currently between “third winter” and “the pollening”, meaning “actual spring” is supposedly still some way off. It's absolutely FREEZING. I think we might be here. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/Pf7Z3iPMNY The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning as “snow and hail showers could lead to icy surfaces with possible travel disruption” for Thursday.  Then Thursday morning, the warning was extended for midnight on Friday until 10am too, due to possible snow and ice across the far southeast of England. ⚠️ Yellow weather warning issued ⚠️Snow and ice across the far southeast of EnglandFriday 0000 – 1000Latest info 👉 https://t.co/QwDLMfRBfsStay #WeatherAware⚠️ pic.twitter.com/hIV6Xm0bI6
