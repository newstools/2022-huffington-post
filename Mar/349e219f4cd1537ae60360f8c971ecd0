Russia is failing to break the spirit of the Ukrainian population as its invasion continues to stall, according to UK officials. In an intelligence briefing last night, the ministry of defence (MoD) said attempts to use media manipulation, propaganda and install pro-Kremlin local leaders have so far been unsuccessful. However, they also warned that Russia is likely to respond with “increasingly violent and coercive measures in an attempt to suppress the Ukrainian population”.

On Sunday, it emerged that Russia has suffered “considerable losses” in Ukraine and were now resorting to “indiscriminate shelling” because of their lack of progress on the ground. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has said the war in Ukraine is “disastrous for the world”. He made the comments in a phone call with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The leaders discussed the grave situation in Ukraine, and the Prime Minister said he believed the actions of Putin’s regime were deeply disturbing and disastrous for the world. “The pair agreed that Ukraine’s integrity and territorial sovereignty must be respected. “Russia needed to adhere to the UN Charter, the leaders said, and both agreed that respect for international law was the only way to ensure global peace and prosperity.”
