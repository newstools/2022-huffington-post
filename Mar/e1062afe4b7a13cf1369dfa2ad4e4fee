Am expecting Brandon and Victoria to wow America :).” When a fan then asked Mark if he wasn’t on the show due to his commitments to The Chase Australia, he replied: “No they just didn’t renew me. No reason was offered.” No they just didn’t renew me. No reason was offered Earlier this year, Mark apologised to viewers of The Chase after he walked off the ITV show following his defeat in the Final Chase during an episode. The quizzing expert was seen punching the set at the end of the show after the four remaining contestants managed to bag £21,000 with just a few seconds left on the clock. After host Bradley Walsh congratulated all four winners on their impressive win, he asked The Beast what he had to say. After congratulating the winners, Mark then said “I’m off”, before storming off and punching part of the set. “I apologise to any kids watching, that is not how you should take defeat,” Bradley told viewers. Mark later took to Twitter to apologise for his actions, which he said was down to his mental health being “shot” before the episode was filmed.
