In text accompanying the tweeted picture of the three surrounded by daffodils, the Hampstead and Kilburn MP wrote: “So lovely to have uplifting conversations with Richard and Nazanin today. “They are both relentless in their pursuit of justice and raised the plight of Morad Tahbaz with me. Here I was hoping to sleep for a week… “Here’s their first family selfie! #NazaninIsFree.” So lovely to have uplifting conversations with Richard and Nazanin today.They are both relentless in their pursuit of justice and raised the plight of Morad Tahbaz with me.
