He may not have been in the running at this year’s Oscars, but when it came to the red carpet, Timothée Chalamet made sure he was one of the stand-outs of the night. The star of the sci-fi epic Dune – which was nominated for a whopping 10 Academy Awards at this year’s ceremony – turned heads as he made his way into the event, posing for photographers in a bare-chested ensemble. Putting his own spin on “black tie fashion”, Timothée decided against wearing a shirt underneath his glittering bejeweled blazer, also sporting some plain black suit trousers and a silver pendant. And as photos of Timothée on the red carpet made their way online, fans on Twitter had a lot of thoughts… During his relatively short time in the public eye, Timothée has consistently made bold statements when it comes to his fashion. Back in 2019, the Oscar-nominated star actor caused a similar stir when he appeared on the Golden Globes red carpet in a spangly harness. He was also among the famous co-chairs at the Met Gala in 2021, alongside Billie Eilish, Amanda Gorman and Naomi Osaka. Although he wasn’t among this year’s Oscars nominees, Timothée previously received a nod in 2018 for his performance in the coming-of-age drama Call Me By Your Name. His film Dune is in the running for Best Picture, also receiving recognition in technical categories like Best Original Score, Best Production Design and Best Score.
