Whether it’s a workplace incident that’s left you feeling mentally drained, an unexpected tiff with your partner or a spat with a friend – or simply the ongoing state of the world – we get it, the stress can feel overwhelming at times.  And if things have been a little ‘wobbly’, there’s no shame in a little self-care at the end of the week. When you’re feeling low, treating yourself to something small can be a really simple way to nudge your spirits in the right direction.  With that in mind, we’ve put together a guide to a range of lovely pick-me-ups you might fancy getting for yourself. Even better, they’re all £20 or under.
