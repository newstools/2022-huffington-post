BBC News presenter Joanna Gosling was visibly moved while announcing the news that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is “heading to Tehran airport and on her way home”. It is hoped the British-Iranian mother is about to leave Iran where she has been detained since 2016, her MP Tulip Siddiq has said. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her fellow detainee Anoosheh Ashoori are believed to be heading to Tehran airport in a bid to leave the country. While announcing the breaking news story on Wednesday’s BBC News, Joanna was overcome with emotion.

But there is still nervousness in Whitehall about the ongoing situation, with sources stressing the pair will not be free until they are actually on a plane out of Iran.
