While all the ads might want us to believe that mums are genuinely looking forward to getting some garden shears or a new saucepan on Mother’s Day, let’s get real for a moment: this frankly isn’t the case.  There’s nothing wrong with a cute and tacky gift now and then – but there’s only a certain amount of ‘Mum’-adorned mugs and aprons one woman can take! So step away from the slipper socks, give the bath bombs a wide berth, and hide the heart-shaped jewellery – because this year, Mum’s gift should be gimmick-free. Instead, have a mooch through this list, and pick her up something she actually wants this Mother’s Day.
