It’s the most wonderful day of the year – if you’re a school child maybe. “Love books, hate World Book Day. Sorry, but that’s the truth when you’re a parent,” our former parenting writer, Victoria Richards, wrote pre-pandemic. And she’s not alone. Twitter last night was sweaty with the fevered brows of parents trying to pull together eleventh-hour literary costume for their kids. Hopefully your munchkin is all but packed off to school, dressed as Harry Potter or Matilda Wormwood or Where’s Wally – even if that means stripping your own stripey jumper off your back at the school gate like Julia in Motherland. But if you’ve forgotten, f-ed up, or simply can’t be bothered with the palaver of it all, we’ve rounded up some of the best tweets from parents who feel similarly.  Any other parents out there throwing together a world book day costume?! 📚 pic.twitter.com/LhzWUEnlcj Are you running around to make a costume for your kids “world book day” tomorrow or are they waiting until tomorrow morning to tell you.

Me too! I have just this evening realised that half my costume is still at my parents house!!! And I’m too tired to go get it!!!
