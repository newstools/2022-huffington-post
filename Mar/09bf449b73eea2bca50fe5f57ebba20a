And while you won’t catch us swapping the coats for cardis just yet, we’re definitely looking forward to more evenings spent hanging out and hosting friends and family outdoors – rather than just on the sofa.  You don’t have to have a large and luscious garden to really enjoy your outdoor space, whether you’ve got a tiny patch of patio or a small slice of balcony,  In fact, with a few simple furniture additions, and the odd accessory or two, you can quickly and easily turn that barren balcony into your own personal haven.
