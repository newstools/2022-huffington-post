Holby City stars past and present have said an emotional goodbye to the BBC medical drama, as it came to end after 23 years on Tuesday night.  The final episode saw the death of surgeon Jac Naylor, played by Rosie Marcel since 2005, following a long-running storyline about the effects of a brain tumour. It also featured the reappearance of past characters including Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) and Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu), as Jac’s organs were donated to people around the country.  Actor Rosie Marcel ended the series with a poignant monologue about the NHS, before pictures of previous cast members flashed up on screen as the credits rolled. After the show aired, Chizzy tweeted: “This is actually breaking my heart. Holby meant so much to so many people, including me. I’m in bits. Didn’t think it would affect me like this…”  She added: “Thank you Holby City for changing my life.” This is actually breaking my heart. Holby meant so much to so many people, including me.

Fellow original star Angela Griffin, who played Jasmine Hopkins, said she was “very emotional” watching the finale. @malyoung @BBCHolbyCity I think the utmost respect should go to Mal Young who had the foresight to create such a groundbreaking show which became a hotbed for talent which will live on. #HolbyCityFinale Very emotional watching @BBCHolbyCity Holby City was conceived as a spin-off from Casualty, and debuted in 1999. The episodes were set in the same hospital despite Casualty being filmed in Bristol, and later Cardiff, while Holby was shot in Elstree in Hertfordshire.  The BBC announced Holby would be ending last year in order to “reshape the BBC’s drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country”. It stated that this was to help “make room for new opportunities” as part of the broadcaster’s “commitment to make more programmes across the UK”. The BBC has since announced the return of school-based drama Waterloo Road, which will return to filming in Greater Manchester.
