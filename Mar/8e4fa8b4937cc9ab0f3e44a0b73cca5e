British MPs have given a standing ovation to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he gave an historic address to the House of Commons. MPs took to their feet even before Zelenskyy, who appeared via a live video link from Ukraine, had said a word. Echoing Winston Churchill, a defiant Zelenskyy said: “We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, the fields, the shores and in the streets.” MPs welcome Ukrainian President Zelensky with a standing ovation as he begins his speech to a packed House of Commonshttps://t.co/pEN7iIJiJm pic.twitter.com/TRImnBSV9J Concluding his speech, he thanked Boris Johnson by name and called on the UK for more support.
