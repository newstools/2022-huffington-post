Dune was the big winner at this year’s Oscars, scooping an impressive six of the 10 awards it was nominated for. Coda, the coming-of-age drama about the titular “child of deaf adults”, scooped the coveted Best Picture title, also picking up Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur and Best Adapted Screenplay. Of the remaining acting wins, Jessica Chastain, Ariana DeBose and Will Smith (who was at the centre of the night’s stand-out moment) all picked up their first Oscar for their performances in The Eyes Of Tammy Faye, West Side Story and King Richard, respectively. Going into Sunday night’s ceremony, The Power Of The Dog was leading the way with 12 nominations, but ended up winning just one. This was for its director Jane Campion, who became only the third woman in history to take home Best Director. Meanwhile, British winners included Riz Ahmed – who scooped an Oscar for his live-action short – filmmaker Sir Kenneth Granagh and costume designer Jenny Beavan, for her work on Cruella.
