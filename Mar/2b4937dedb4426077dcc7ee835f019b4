There was disbelief on social media as Gavin Williamson – the twice-sacked minister who oversaw an exams fiasco – was handed a knighthood by Boris Johnson. Downing Street said on Thursday the Tory MP, who was widely criticised for his handling of schools as education secretary during the coronavirus pandemic, would be conferred the honour by the Queen. It is understood the 45-year-old has been ennobled on the basis of his political and public service. It's all just so blatant. pic.twitter.com/7NtsvU8iF7 as if the news wasn't grim enough, Gavin Williamson has been given a knighthood The former fireplace manufacturing firm managing director – who, as a Tory party enforcer, kept a pet tarantula named Cronus in a glass box on his desk – has a dubious track record in the upper echelons of politics. His handling of disruption to schools during the height of the pandemic and the grading of GCSEs and A-levels after exams were cancelled was widely seen as disastrous. Williamson was rewarded with the role as education secretary by Johnson despite being sacked as defence secretary by Theresa May. It is worth noting he helped run Johnson’s successful 2019 campaign to become Tory leader. The firing from defence came following an inquiry into the leak of information from a security council meeting about Chinese telecoms firm Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s 5G mobile network. Williamson denied being the source of the leak, despite having an 11-minute conversation with a journalist that broke the story. Away from policy errors, Williamson is perhaps best-known in British politics for his habit of making a gaffe. Here are some of his biggest: In September, Williamson confused footballer Marcus Rashford with another sports star. The education secretary told the Evening Standard that he had met Rashford, a prominent campaigner for free school meals, while it was later revealed he had actually met rugby union player, Maro Itoje. Both men are Black. Referencing his Mancunian origins and Itoje’s London upbringing, Rashford later tweeted: “Accent could have been a giveaway [emoji].” Accent could have been a giveaway 🤣 https://t.co/CO2oQjiZZ6 Last year, Williamson said he did not remember what A-Level grades he received – despite remembering opening the envelope. In an interview on LBC, the education secretary said his results allowed him to go to Bradford University. “For a lad growing up in Scarborough, Bradford was the most exotic and exciting place in the whole world,” he said. “I remember walking up to those college doors, going into my college at sixth form, getting the envelope, opening up that envelope, seeing the grades on there and feeling absolute delight.” But pressed on what his results were, Williamson said: “I’ve forgotten, it was so long ago.” This was the moment Education Secretary Gavin Williamson 'forgot' his own A-Level results live on LBC @NickFerrariLBC | #alevelresults2021 https://t.co/yICE4yZPAO Williamson was only able to reveal he did not get three A*s. In the wake of the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in 2018, Williamson gave his assessment of UK-Russian relations after the Sailsbury nerve agent attack. Blaming Russia for the incident, he said: “It is absolutely atrocious and outrageous what Russia did in Salisbury. We have responded to that. “Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up.” The tenor of his warning clearly had little effect. Gavin Williamson getting a knighthood presumably for telling Russia to "go away and shut up", because it can't be over anything else When Gavin Williamson said, "Russia should go away and should shut up."Russia obviously ignored this warning, as the wife of a former crony of Vladimir Putin decided to donate £30,000 to dine with the former Defence Secretary instead.What did this buy them? Days after his Rashford gaffe, Williamson urged teachers to return to in-person teaching – during a virtual appearance at a conference. The Times’ Nicola Woolcock tweeted: “Gavin Williamson doesn’t turn up in person to Universities UK conference in Newcastle – but uses his videolink speech to warn universities to get back to in person teaching...” Williamson was told off by parliamentary authorities after using Instagram in the House of Commons. Then defence secretary, he posted a photo from the government frontbench of the prime minister delivering a statement on Brexit. It was captioned: “The @theresamay making her statement to the House of Commons.” Admittedly, it was more drab than his usual content, which has a distinct weekend warrior energy.  A Commons spokesperson said: “Where [photography] is seen or reported to be happening the individual in question will be asked to stop and reminded of the rules.” In 2018, Williamson was attempting to deliver a speech on Isis in the Middle East when a voice coming from his jacket pocket interrupted proceedings. In what the Mirror suggested was probably the first speech to parliament by an artificial intelligence assistant, Siri could be heard saying: “Hi Gavin, I found something on the web for: ‘In Syria, democratic forces supported by…’” Williamson told MPs: “I’m not sure what caused that intervention, but I do apologise for that. “It is very rare that you’re heckled by your own mobile phone, but on this occasion it is a new parliamentary convention, without a doubt.”
