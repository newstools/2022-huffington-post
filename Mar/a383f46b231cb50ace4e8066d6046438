You probably know that grimy beauty tools can lead to breakouts, not to mention other icky issues such as cold sores and conjunctivitis, but very few of us clean our brushes as often as we should.  According to a study from Cosmetify, one in four of us (that’s 26%) has never washed our makeup brushes. Yikes. And, of those of us who do, one in three (37%) only clean them every six months, and 18% just once a year. That’s a hell of a lot of icky build up, dirt, oil, and grime.  The reality is that makeup tools (brushes and blending sponges) can harbour a lot of bacteria if not cleaned properly. So, for the sake of your skin (and your looks), aim to clean your brushes a little more regularly – somewhere between weekly and fortnightly depending on how often you use them, experts say. To make keeping your go-tos clean and hygienic a little easier (and less time-consuming), we’ve put together a guide to some super useful buys your skin will thank you for. From instant-drying antibacterial sprays to electric sponge presses, we’ve rounded up lots of options for easier brush cleaning.
