Whether it’s a small space for housing the hoover, or a de-facto utility room with a washing machine and dryer, you’re missing a trick if you’re not making the most of this precious storage space. But let’s be honest – home of the hoover, mop, a few coats, and anything else that doesn’t have an obvious home, most of us have let our closets, cabinets, or cupboards under the stairs get into a state of absolute chaos.  Need to get the ironing board out? Good luck – it’s right at the back, balancing on a box of Christmas decorations. Quite frankly, we deserve better than being attacked by a clothes horse as soon as we open the door! So we’ve put together a collection of closet must-haves that’ll help restore order. And best of all, they’re all available on Amazon!
