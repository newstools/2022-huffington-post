Russia’s attempts to seize control of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv have “stalled”, according to UK officials. The latest intelligence briefing from the ministry of defence says “the bulk of Russian forces remain more than 25 kilometres from the city centre”, more than three weeks since the invasion began. The MoD said “fierce Ukrainian resistance” was keeping Vladimir Putin’s troops at bay. However, capturing Kyiv “remains Russia’s primary military objective and they are likely to prioritise attempting to encircle the city over the coming week”, the officials said.

This has led to “widespread destruction and a large number of civilian casualties”, the MoD said. In his latest call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Boris Johnson said he was looking at ways for the UK to step up the military help it is giving. The PM is also expected to call on other world leaders to do more to help Ukraine at this week’s Nato and G7 meetings. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister outlined the UK’s ongoing commitment to work alongside international partners to coordinate support to strengthen Ukraine’s self defence. “The leaders also discussed the ongoing negotiations and the Prime Minister reaffirmed his staunch support for Ukraine’s position.  “Both leaders stressed the continued importance of sanctions in exerting pressure on Putin, and they condemned the abhorrent attacks on innocent civilians, following the appalling bombings in Mariupol. “The Prime Minister expressed his admiration for the bravery of Ukraine and was clear that the UK was committed to stepping up military, economic and diplomatic support in order to help bring an end to this terrible conflict.”
