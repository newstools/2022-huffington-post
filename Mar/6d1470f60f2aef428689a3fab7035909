As any Rihanna fan will tell you, she’s not always the best when it comes to punctuality (particularly when it comes to releasing new music…), but when she finally does arrive, she makes an entrance like no other. The chart-topping singer and beauty entrepreneur is currently in Paris for Fashion Week, where she’s already made headlines once this week with her unique approach to maternity wear. On Tuesday night she was among the A-listers in attendance at Dior’s womenswear fashion show, where she walked the red carpet in a sheer black dress and knee-high boots. It wasn’t just her ensemble at the event that had people talking, though, but also her unbothered reaction when someone informed her she had turned up late for the show. A clip posted on Tuesday night shows the We Found Love star – who is currently pregnant with her first child – walking past a crowd, with one woman repeating at her: “You’re late, you’re late!” Without even pausing, Rihanna is then heard simply responding: “No shit.” Rihanna responds to fan calling her out for being late as she arrives at the Dior fashion show:“No shit.”  pic.twitter.com/FdcLbrunV9 Rih’s nonchalant response quickly went viral on social media, with her fans wasting no time in turning the clip into a ridiculous new meme: Me walking to my desk with Starbucks 20 min after I was supposed to click in and my boss says “you’re late”  pic.twitter.com/CHhI9WXrjg pulling up to work late bcos i had to get a coffee  pic.twitter.com/GSerspEpZB Me walking into work 2 hours late with Starbucks in my hand: pic.twitter.com/wyJ29LFlWa Me showing up late to my work meeting: pic.twitter.com/uxuKaX0uV7 Me clocking in late from lunch  pic.twitter.com/bLs0apRumv Me arriving at every event. pic.twitter.com/4cxN72CLOz me to my coworkers when they force us back into the office next month pic.twitter.com/qqr7gMe4JW Me showing up to work at MY earliest convenience:  pic.twitter.com/PjHtnT5giz jujubee to the judges #DragRace  #DragRaceUK  #DragRaceUKvsTheWorld  pic.twitter.com/qq6pEcZ6Qq When I show up to my class two minutes late after making copies.  pic.twitter.com/kHU6AoTMp9 Me turning up to work  pic.twitter.com/2F8b4FwpkC I’ve watched this so many times I spilled my water at some point 😂 pic.twitter.com/Ra6EX0Hziw someone yells out YOU'RE LATE and Rihanna replies "no shit" but come on we all know everyone else was just early https://t.co/rRBkKpWoAH #PFW22 PAPS: you’re late Rihanna:  pic.twitter.com/0GiK5rVM3b her fucking serve pic.twitter.com/ixHua4iuNC ‘NO SHIT.’ has never sounded this proverbial. pic.twitter.com/DNCvMDtXQx https://t.co/xJPmNyG18s now why would you say that to THE RIHANNA?
