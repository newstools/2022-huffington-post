A glowing Rihanna was a vision in skintight leather when she was joined by partner A$AP Rocky for the Off-White show at Paris Fashion Week on Monday. The music superstar, who is expecting her first child with the rapper, sported a peach leather minidress to the event, teamed with strappy high-heeled sandals and a shearling coat. The show came just months after the death of Off-White founder Virgil Abloh, which rocked the fashion industry in November last year. The US designer, who came to prominence as rapper Kanye West’s creative director and later made history as the first African-American to lead French luxury brand Louis Vuitton, died aged 41 after a private battle with cancer. The show also attracted stars including Idris Elba and his wife Sabrina, Pharrell Williams and footballer Paul Pogba. Supermodel Naomi Campbell appeared topless under a blazer on the runway, with a large necklace covering her chest. Also taking to the catwalk were Cindy Crawford and her daughter Kaia Gerber, as well as tennis champion Serena Williams and models Kendall Jenner and Gigi and Bella Hadid. Kaia was clutching a mobile phone and sunglasses as she made her way down the runway in a striking blue skirt and yellow T-shirt emblazoned with the word Pop. Gigi Hadid sported an equestrian style blue hat, teamed with a navy bomber jacket and full-length tiered blue skirt. It is not yet known who will take over from Virgil Abloh at the helm of Off-White.
