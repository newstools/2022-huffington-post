Kanye West has reportedly been prohibited from performing at the Grammy Awards in the wake of his actions following his split with Kim Kardashian. The Blast first reported that the Grammys axed West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, over “concerning online behavior,” in a scoop that Variety and People later confirmed with West’s rep. Earlier this month, on the same day Kardashian became legally single after divorcing West, he posted a music video for his song “Eazy,” which references Kardashian’s current boyfriend, Pete Davidson. It includes the lines, “God saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson’s ass,” and the claymation music video shows a representation of West kidnapping Davidson, holding Davidson’s decapitated head and burying him alive. He’s also encouraged any fans who see Davidson to “scream” at him and “say Kimye forever.” The Blast, citing “insiders,” reported that one of the final straws was actually West’s online interaction with “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah. Noah had called West’s continual harassment of Kardashian “terrifying to watch,” and West responded by attacking Noah with a racial slur on Instagram, a move that got the rapper banned from the platform for 24 hours. Noah is slated to be hosting this year’s Grammy Awards, while West is up for five awards, including album of the year for “Donda.”
