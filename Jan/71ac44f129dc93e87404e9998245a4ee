An old video of Boris Johnson dancing at a party has resurfaced on social media – and many people are rubbing their eyes. The clip – apparently pre-Covid – was doing the rounds on most platforms the day after Johnson admitted attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the garden of No. 10 during England’s first lockdown. Although, the PM insisted, he believed it had been a “work event” and not a party. The video involves the strains of Lionel Richie’s ‘All Night Long (All Night)’, a flailing lightsaber and the kind of movement that you might charitably describe as “Dad dancing”. The original source of the 40-second clip is unclear.

Here's the register of gifts angle for those wondering: The "light sabre" was a gift from ILM/Lucas Film in June 2013 https://t.co/mRMxlpyrqjAnd press reports suggest it's some sort of tradition for the mayor to dance with chair of London Assembly at Xmas party... The lightsaber is likely to be a gift: the Star Wars weapon of choice was “manufactured and invented” in South Ruislip in Johnson’s Uxbridge constituency, he said in 2019. “I have a lightsaber in my office in Westminster – it is a most beautiful thing which was presented to me by no less a figure than Christopher Lee (who played Count Dooku in Star Wars),” Johnson revealed. Suffice to say much of the online commentary focuses on whether Johnson knows what a party is or not. Just so many questions… https://t.co/VS9zqMWbOO This has been doing the rounds on social media today.
