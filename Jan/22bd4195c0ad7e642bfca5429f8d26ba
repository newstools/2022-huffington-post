90 Day Fiancé star Stephanie Matto and her $200K “farts in a jar” business made headlines the world over this week when it was revealed she’d been rushed to hospital with chronic wind in the most ironic ailment ever.  Well, if you thought that was shocking, you should hear the “science” behind her pongy product.  The reality star risked putting Steph’s Packed Lunch viewers off their sarnies on Thursday, when she appeared on the Channel 4 daytime show to discuss her £38k-a-month business.  When host Steph McGovern asked Stephanie about the process of farting in a jar, she revealed it actually involves more than you might think.  “I have it down to a pretty good science,” she said. “I bought these fabric flower petals and I fart directly on them because the fabric really captures the scent better. “And then I just put that flower petal into a jar, I seal it up, I tape it and then I ship it out.” "There was a specific client who wanted me to eat cheese because he wanted a particular aroma" 💨😷 The reality star who's made nearly $200k selling farts in a jar answers the #StephsPackedLunch family questions!  @StepankaMatto @StephLunch @gareththomas14 @LukeKempner pic.twitter.com/MSI9iFp1zV Revealing how she got into sending people farts in a jar in the first place, Stephanie said: “I have a YouTube channel for about eight years and a lot of my fans that were into me were asking for strange items, articles of clothing. But one repeat request I’ve been getting throughout the years is a fart. “I thought it was just a joke, people just messing with me, but one day I decided to throw them up on sale and see if people would buy them. I wasn’t expecting people to but they actually sold out within two days.” Earlier this week, Stephanie revealed how producing so much wind eventually took its toll after she consumed three protein shakes and a huge bowl of black bean soup in one day to fulfil her surprisingly popular product. Feeling that “something was not right” with a pressure in her stomach that moved upwards throughout her body, Stephanie says she thought she was “having a stroke”. After arriving at the hospital, it was made clear to Stephanie that she wasn’t experiencing a stroke or heart attack, but “very intense gas pains”.  “I was advised to change my diet and to take a gas suppressant medication, which has effectively ended my business,” she said.  Steph’s Packed Lunch airs weekdays at 12.30pm on Channel 4.
