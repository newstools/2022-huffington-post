It seems the whole UK is eagerly waiting for Sue Gray’s report into Downing Street’s partygate – meaning the internet is now rammed with jokes about the national anticipation. Gray, a senior civil servant, was tasked by the prime minister to look into the parties alleged to have taken place in Downing Street throughout lockdown. Her findings are set to be released any day now after a flurry of contradicting reports about whether or not it would be delayed any further. It’s believed evidence she passed to the police triggered the Met’s new investigation into “a number” of the reported gatherings. Once her findings are sent to Downing Street, the prime minister has committed to publishing the complete report and then standing before the Commons to give a full statement on its conclusions. Gray’s report could also turn out to be the tipping point for many Tory backbenchers who are on the fence about ousting Boris Johnson. The government has repeatedly deferred any probing questions about various Downing Street parties to Gray’s report as well, putting even more pressure on its publication. Here’s a roundup of all the jokes which perfectly capture how everyone is waiting for what could be the final chapter of the two-month Partygate saga. pic.twitter.com/zz1cpr5DbB Sue Gray’s office this morning pic.twitter.com/Qs0y66nfRI Boris Johnson keeping Sue Gray in her office to delay the report… pic.twitter.com/ag1poWB26T Would be pretty funny if Sue Gray has completely forgotten about the reportNow she's pulling an all-nighter and using the Thesaurus feature on every word to make it sound more intelligent Sue Gray rn pic.twitter.com/Ile6j3pvIv Sue Gray tonight pic.twitter.com/7LjakUF5Xd Entering Day 3 of waiting for Sue Gray’s Downing Street parties report to drop like: pic.twitter.com/uRwsk164bw Sue Gray slowly drags a JPEG of Boris Johnson into her Microsoft Word document.

Sue Gray is believed to have finished her report yesterday, and 24 hours on hasn't handed it over.
