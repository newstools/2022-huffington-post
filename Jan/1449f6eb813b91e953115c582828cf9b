An American news reporter has reassured viewers she is doing well after she was knocked down by a car during a live TV broadcast. Remarkably, Tori Yorgey managed to bounce back and continue her live report after being floored by the vehicle on Wednesday night. The WSAZ reporter was at the scene of a water break in the West Virginia city of Dunbar when shocked viewers saw her being mown down. “Oh my God. I just got hit by a car, but I’m okay,” she exclaimed after the collision.

I am flattered by the kindness and well wishes,” she tweeted. “I am feeling fine, just a little sore! Thank you all so much.” Wow. I am flattered by the kindness and well wishes. I am feeling fine, just a little sore!  Thank you all so much. For the record: @WSAZirr couldn’t see what was happening in that moment.
