As Covid travel rules and tests relax, more of us can start dreaming about where we’d like to venture to next. There’s nothing like the excitement of booking a holiday, especially when you start researching places to stay. Hotels are good for convenience but the right AirBnb can transform your trip and give you a lush – and local – experience. There are millions of different Airbnbs worldwide, but from an A-frame with a view to die for in Utah to a charming 18th century farmhouse in France, these are the most liked boltholes on Instagram. The most liked photo on Airbnb’s Instagram profile in 2021 is all about the view: a breathtaking panorama of the Zion Mountains taken from the elevated vantage point of an A-frame cabin. Located high in the redwoods of Monte Rio, the Crow’s Nest provides a birds eye view of the old forest surrounding the Raven Rock Treehouse. The Woodlands House sits on five acres of an old growth private forest and offers two outdoor decks surrounded by towering pine trees. This gorgeous modern villa is characterised by clean lines, open spaces and huge windows which gives the feeling of indoor outdoor living. This stunning boathouse is docked at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers in Belgrade. Surrounded by century-old oaks, this traditional wood frame farmhouse dates back to the 18th century but a recent renovation has added modern comforts like a heated pool. This double-height timber-clad cabin is surrounded by forest and trees and close to the mountain villages of Mineral del Chico and Mineral del Monte.
