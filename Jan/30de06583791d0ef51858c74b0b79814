This year’s awards season got off to a somewhat muted start on Sunday night, with a Golden Globes ceremony unlike any before it. After a year of controversy and boycotts relating to a lack of diversity at the Hollywood Foreign Press Association – the organisation who chooses the winners from the world of TV and film at the Globes each year – and shady dealings behind the scenes, the show went ahead without a live TV broadcast. There were also no celebrity guests, with the show instead being attended by “select HFPA members and grantees”. Nonetheless, the winners for 2022 have now been revealed, with the remake of West Side Story and the Western film The Power Of The Dog leading the way in the cinema categories with three wins each. Also on three wins is the hit drama Succession, while Kate Winslet, Andrew Garfield and Sir Kenneth Branagh were the British stars recognised for their work in the past year. Meanwhile, Mj Rodriguez made history as the first transgender star to be recognised for her performance in the final series of Pose.
