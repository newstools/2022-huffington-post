Sinéad O’Connor has announced that her 17-year-old son Shane has died. The singer shared the tragic news in the early hours of Saturday morning, two days after the teenager – whose father is Irish folk musician Dónal Lunny – was reported as missing. “My beautiful son, Nevi’im Nesta Ali Shane O’Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God,” she wrote. “May he rest in peace and may no one follow his example. My baby. I love you so much. Please be at peace.” In a subsequent tweet, Sinéad again described Shane as the “light of my life”. “You will always be my light,” she said. “We will always be together. No boundary can separate us.” My beautiful son, Nevi’im Nesta Ali Shane O’Connor, the very light of my life, decided to end his earthly struggle today and is now with God.

You will always be my light.  We will always be together.
