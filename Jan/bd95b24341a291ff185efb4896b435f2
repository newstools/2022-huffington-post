He began his film career in the early 2000s, eventually winning the César Award for Most Promising Actor in 2004 for his performance in A Very Long Engagement, at the age of 20. Later, he portrayed Hannibal Lecter in the 2007 drama Hannibal Rising and took the lead in a French-language biopic of the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. For his role in Saint Laurent, he was nominated for the César Award for Best Actor in 2015, which he eventually won two years later for his performance in the drama It’s Only The End Of The World. More recently, he joined the cast of the Marvel series Moon Knight, the trailer for which debuted earlier this week. The French star will appear opposite Oscar Isaac and Ethan Hawke as Anton Mogart – otherwise known as Midnight Man – in the new show, which will debut on the streaming service Disney+ in March. Gaspard is survived by his partner of eight years, the French singer and model Gaëlle Piétri, and their five-year-old son named Orso.
