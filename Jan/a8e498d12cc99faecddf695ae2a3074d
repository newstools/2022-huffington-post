Rupert Grint has revealed he’d definitely be up for returning to the Harry Potter franchise in the future – but only on one condition. The 33-year-old actor rose to global fame as a teenager playing Ron Weasley in all eight of the fantasy films. Over a decade on from the release of the final instalment in the series, Rupert has admitted that he’d love to play Ron again in a future project. “​​I can’t really think of a reason not to,” he told Thursday’s Good Morning Britain. “I love that character, I love that world. It’s a huge part of my life.” But Rupert added that he would have to be joined by his former co-stars. “I would [come back],” he said. “If the others did, I think, yeah!” And while he confessed to feeling a “kind of ownership of Ron”, he added that he enjoyed seeing Paul Thornley playing the character in the official Harry Potter sequel play The Cursed Child. “I loved seeing the play,” he continued. “And it was a real thrill seeing someone else take that body over.” 'I can't really think of a reason not to really.'Good news Harry Potter fans, Rupert Grint tells @RichardAArnold that he would like to reprise his role as Ron Weasley.Watch GMB on ITV and on ITV Hub 👉 https://t.co/6iQ6ebeOEQ pic.twitter.com/YpMhsgJaVu Harry Potter And The Cursed Child debuted in London’s West End in 2016, and has since moved across the pond to Broadway.
