Strictly Come Dancing performers Nadiya Bychkova and Kai Widdrington have been spotted looking cosy behind the scenes of the show’s current UK tour. The professional dancers – who are both single – have been at the centre of romance rumours since earlier this week. In pictures published by The Sun on Friday night, they were seen kissing alone in a hotel bar after the Strictly tour stopped in Newcastle a day earlier.

Earlier this year, the Ukrainian-Slovenian dancer confirmed she and her footballer fiancé Matija Skarabot had split up last year. She and Matija share a five-year-old daughter named Mila.  Meanwhile, Kai was paired up with TV personality AJ Odudu during last year’s Strictly, which marked his first series as a professional dancer on the show. Over the course of the run, the two were repeatedly at the centre of speculation that they were an item, though they consistently downplayed the rumours. AJ had been due to appear on the new Strictly tour, but was forced to pull out due to an ongoing injury. She has been replaced by Maisie Smith, who made it to the Strictly final in 2020, and is currently dancing with Kai. Spokespeople for Nadiya Bychkova and Kai Widdrington did not respond to HuffPost UK’s requests for comment on the initial romance rumours earlier this week. We have once again contacted their representatives for additional comment.
