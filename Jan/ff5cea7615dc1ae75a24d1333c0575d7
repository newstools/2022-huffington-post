Piers Morgan has said “cowardly threats have consequences” after it emerged that an arrest has been made over online threats made against the former Good Morning Britain host. Officers from two of the country’s biggest police forces have been probing death threats sent to the TV star and his eldest son Spencer, the Sun reports. The male suspect is believed to have been arrested under the Malicious Communications Act, following a six-month investigation. It comes almost a year after the first message was sent to the broadcaster and journalist.

The suspect was arrested on suspicion of sending death threats on 3 August, and his phone and tablets were removed for forensic analysis. He is understood to have been released on bail, with a decision imminent over whether he will be charged.
