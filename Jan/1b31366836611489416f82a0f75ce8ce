Gwyneth Paltrow has created a new limited edition candle to mark the anniversary of a landmark US supreme court decision on abortion rights. The Oscar-winning actor and Goop founder said the Hands Off My Vagina candle would honour the historic Roe v Wade case on 22 January. She said $25 (£18) from the sale of each candle on her Goop lifestyle site would be donated to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Foundation’s Reproductive Freedom Project.  Following the Roe v Wade case in 1973 it was ruled the US Constitution protects a pregnant woman’s right to choose to have an abortion. In a post on social media, Gwyneth said the campaign was to support the “critical right” to protect rights and basic freedoms. “The word ‘vagina’ holds a lot of power,” she wrote. “And yet, there is a recurring need to say: Hands off. Hands off our vaginas in any context where they’re not invited. “Your reproductive organs; your choice”. The candles, which cost £55, will be sold on goop.com and donations from the proceeds will be made until 1 July. Last year, another of Gwyneth’s candles hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons after one of the star’s ‘vagina scented candles’ exploded in a British woman’s home.
