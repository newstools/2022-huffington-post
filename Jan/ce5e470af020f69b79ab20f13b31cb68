Tennis legend Chris Evert announced Friday that she’s been diagnosed with stage 1 ovarian cancer. “I feel very lucky that they caught it early and expect positive results from my chemo plan,” Evert, 67, wrote in a statement shared on Twitter. “Thanks to all of you for respecting my need to focus on my health and treatment plan.” Evert, a tennis analyst for ESPN, said she would “appear from home at times” during the sports network’s coverage of the Australian Open tournament, which starts Monday. https://t.co/LVUsO3QqfD pic.twitter.com/B8WwKxsFmc Evert opened up about being diagnosed with ovarian cancer — from which her sister, Jeanne Evert Dubin, died aged 62 in 2020 ― in an essay co-written by her longtime friend, ESPN journalist Chris McKendry, also shared Friday. It was discovered following a preventive hysterectomy, she said. “I’ve lived a very charmed life. Now I have some challenges ahead of me. But, I have comfort in knowing the chemotherapy is to ensure that cancer does not come back,” said Evert, who retired from professional tennis in 1989 after winning a stunning 18 Grand Slam singles and three doubles titles. “As someone who has always had control over my life, I have no idea how I’ll respond to chemotherapy,” the mother-of-three added. “I have to give in to something higher.”
