A minister has rejected bringing in any more Covid restrictions despite the army being sent in to support the NHS. Paul Scully said he did not think further restrictions were needed at “this moment in time” but plan b will be reviewed before January 26. It comes as the NHS was put on a war footing, with 200 Armed Forces personnel deployed to hospitals in London as they battle with staff shortages. Scully told Sky News: “We’re looking at the data but we’ve seen what’s happening in London which was leading the way in the curve on the case numbers.  “We don’t see the need to do it at this moment in time. We’ll clearly be reviewing our plan b scenario before 26 of January and will come to parliament with the decision that’s been taken at that time.” However, a report in today’s Times newspaper claimed that health secretary Sajid Javid has warned that Britain risks being forced into another lockdown after the decision to relax international travel restrictions.  Pressed on whether they will lockdown again, Scully replied: “I don’t believe at this stage we need any more lockdowns.” Military medics will help NHS doctors and nurses with patient care, while general duty personnel will help fill gaps caused by other absences. The Royal College of Nursing has said the deployment means the government can no longer deny there is a “staffing crisis” within the NHS. Patricia Marquis, the RCN director for England, said: “The prime minister and others can no longer be dismissive of questions about the ability of NHS staff to deliver safe care. “Once the military has been brought in, where does the government turn next in a bid to ‘ride out’ the wave rather than deal with it?” This is a breaking news story and will be updated.
