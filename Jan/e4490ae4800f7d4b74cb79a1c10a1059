The Conservative Party is engulfed in a civil war as a senior Tory dismissed its leader in Scotland as a “lightweight” after urging Boris Johnson to quit. Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg’s damning criticism of Douglas Ross – who is a member of the Westminster and Holyrood parliaments – came on a day of deep division over “partygate”. Johnson on Wednesday admitted attending a “bring your own booze” gathering in the garden of No 10 during England’s first lockdown – although he insisted he believed it had been a “work event”.

But chancellor Rishi Sunak, having missed the statement in the Commons, took to Twitter eight hours later to say the PM was “right to apologise”.
