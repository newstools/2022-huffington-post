As restrictions continue to lift – and working from home is no longer a requirement – many of us are heading back to the office for real this time.  You’ve long since adjusted to working in leggings (and fallen deeply in love with that extra hour in bed). Now you’ve got to get used to getting dressed again and packing, shock horror, a work bag. Admittedly, all this change can be quite a shock to the system, and a lot to get your head around.  Whether you’re excited to be getting back to your ‘normal’ routine or you’re already dreading the commute, there are some nice-to-have items that can make this transition period (and those earlier mornings) a little easier.  To help you fill your work bag with the essentials you’ll need, we’ve compiled a list of handy back-to-work products that will see you through your commute, that first face-to-face meeting with your boss, and beyond.
