Cheslie Kryst, a former Miss USA winner, Extra presenter, and attorney, has died at the age of 30. “In devastation and great sorrow, we share the passing of our beloved Cheslie,” her family said in a statement. “Her great light was one that inspired others around the world with her beauty and strength. She cared, she loved, she laughed and she shined.” They continued: “Cheslie embodied love and served others, whether through her work as an attorney fighting for social justice, as Miss USA and as a host on Extra. But most importantly as a daughter, sister, friend, mentor and colleague — we know her impact will live on.” Chelsie was found dead just after 7am on Sunday morning outside the Orion Condominium building in Manhattan where she lived, the New York Police Department confirmed to HuffPost.  She lived on the ninth floor and had last been seen on the 29 January, law enforcement sources told the New York Post.  Chelsie had written on Instagram hours earlier: “May this day bring you rest and peace.” Chelsie won the Miss USA pageant in 2019 as a representative for North Carolina and went on to place in the top 10 at the Miss Universe competition. As well as being a licensed attorney, she was an Emmy-nominated correspondent for the entertainment show Extra, where she worked since October 2019. She was also a passionate advocate for criminal justice reform and had worked pro-bono for clients serving excessive prison time for low-level drug offences.
