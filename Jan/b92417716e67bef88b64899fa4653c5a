A day synonymous with soppiness, Valentine’s Day might seem more cringey than cutesy if you and your partner (or prospective partner) aren’t a particularly mushy pair. But just because you’re not into heart-shaped chocolates and balloons, that doesn’t mean you should forgo showing appreciation for the person you’re very much into on February 14.  If the typical storefront offering really isn’t in line with your aesthetic, then how about going for a slightly cheeky option? Whether you’re after a saucy innuendo, or a bit of playful banter, these Valentine’s Day cards are spot-on alternatives for those who want to show their partner how much they cherish them, without any cheesiness.
