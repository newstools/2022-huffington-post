Rihanna and A$AP Rocky were first rumoured to be dating way back in 2013, and later rekindled their romance in 2020. In an interview published late last year, Rocky described the Diamonds singer as the “love of my life”, saying his life was “so much better” since they began their relationship. “[It’s] so much better when you got the One,” he told the magazine. “She amounts to probably, like, a million of the other ones. I think when you know, you know. She’s the One.” Asked by the magazine whether he felt “ready to be a father”, he added: “If that’s in my destiny, absolutely… I think I’d be an incredible, remarkably, overall amazing dad. I would have a very fly child. Very.”
